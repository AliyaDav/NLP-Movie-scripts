GIMLI: You young rascals! A merry hunt you've led us on, and now we find you feasting and smoking.

GOLLUM: Yes, the stairs ... and then?
SMEAGOL: Up, up, up, up the stairs we go . . . until we come to . . . ... the Tunnel!
GOLLUM: And when they go in, there's no coming out. She's always hungry, she always needs to feed. She must eat, all She gets is filthy Orcses.
SMEAGOL: And they doesn't taste very nice, does they, Precious? .
GOLLUM: No . . . not very nice at all, my love. She hungers for sweeter meats . . .

FRODO: Sm. . . a
SAM: Call me a liar! You're a liar!
FRODO: Sam! If you scare him off, we're lost.
SAM: I don't care! I can't do it, Mr Frodo. I won' t wait around for him to kill us !
FRODO: I'm not sending him away.
SAM: You don't see it, do you? He's a villain!
FRODO: We can't do this by ourselves, Sam. Not without a guide. I need you on my side.

GANDALF: And what did you tell him? Speak!
PIPPIN: He asked me my name, I didn't answer . . . he hurt me . . .
GANDALF: What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring?
GANDALF: There was no lie in Pippin's eyes; a fool, but an honest fool he remains. He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.

THEODEN: Tell me. Why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to ours?

MERRY: Come on!
PIPPIN: How far is Minas Tirith?
GANDALF: Three days ride as the Nazgul flies and you'd better hope we don't have one of those on our tail.
MERRY: Here - something for the road.
PIPPIN: The last of the Longbottom Leaf.
MERRY: I know you've run out . . . you smoke too much, Pip.

GANDALF: Pippin!
PIPPIN: I offer you my service, such as it is, in payment of this debt.
GANDALF: Get up! My Lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir, but it is not now. War is coming ... the Enemy is on your doorstep. As Steward, you are charged with the defence of this city. Where are Condor's armies?
: Final Revision - October, 2003 32. CONTINUED:
DENETHOR: You think you are wise, Mithrandir, yet for all your subtleties.you have not wisdom. Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind? I have seen more than you know. With your left hand you would use me as a shield against Mordor and with your right you would seek to supplant me.
GANDALF: Authority is not given to you to deny the return of the King - Steward!
DENETHOR: The rule of Condor is mine, and no others!
GANDALF: Come.
PIPPIN: So, I imagine this is just a ceremonial position . . . I mean, they don't actually expect me to do any fighting . . . do they?
GANDALF: You're in the service of the Steward now - you're going to have to do as you're told, Peregrin Took . . . Guard of the Citadel!
PIPPIN: It's so quiet.
GANDALF: It's the deep breath before the plunge.
PIPPIN: I don't want to be in a battle . . . but waiting on the edge of one I can't escape is even worse. L : Is there any hope, Gandalf - for Frodo and Sam?
: Final Revision - October, 2003 34. CONTINUED:
GANDALF: There never was much hope.
GANDALF: This will be the end of Gondor as we know it. Here the hammerstroke will fall hardest.

FARAMIR: What would you have me do?
DENETHOR: I will not yield the River and Pelennor unfought - Osgiliath must be retaken.
FARAMIR: My Lord, Osgiliath is overrun.
DENETHOR: Much must be risked in war. Is there a Captain here who still has the courage to do his Lord's will?
FARAMIR: You wish now that our places had been exchanged, that I had died and Boromir had lived?
: Final Revision - October, 2003 54, CONTINUED:

SAM: What are you up to? Sneaking off, are we?
SMEAGOL: Sneaking? Sneaking? Fat Hobbit is always so polite. Smeagol shows them secret ways that nobody else could find and they say "Sneak!", "Sneak!". Very nice friends, oh yes, my Precious, very nice.
SAM: Alright, alright - you just startled me is all. What were you doing?
SMEAGOL: Sneaking!

FRODO: He doesn't eat it . . . he can't have taken it.
GOLLUM: What's this? Crumbs on his jacketses! He took it! He took it! I seen him, he's always stuffing himself when Master's not looking!

FRODO: I ' m alright.
SAM: No, no, you're not alright! You're exhausted! It's that Gollum; it's this place; it's that thing around your neck. I could help a bit . . . I could carry it for a while - share the load.

DENETHOR: Can you sing, Master Hobbit?
PIPPIN: Well . . . yes, at least, well enough for my own people ... but we have no songs for great halls and evil times . . . we seldom sing of anything more terrible than wind or rain.
DENETHOR: And why should your songs be unfit for my halls, or for hours such as these. Come - sing me a song!

LEGOLAS: The horses are restless . . . And the men are -;. quiet ..?
EOMER: They grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain . . .
GIMLI: That road there - where does that lead?
LEGOLAS: It is the road to the Dimholt ... The door under the mountain.

EOMER: None who venture there ever return. That mountain is evil . . .
GIMLI: Let's find some food.
EOWYN: There! A true Esquire of Rohan.
MERRY: Sorry. It isn't all that dangerous. It isn't even sharp.
: Final Revision - October, 2003 65, CONTINUED:
EOWYN: Well, that's no good. You won't kill many Ores with a blunt blade. Come on.
EOWYN: To the Smithy .- go!
EOMER: You should not encourage him.
EOWYN: And you should not doubt him.
EOMER: I do not doubt his heart ... Only the reach of his arm.
EOWYN: Why should Merry be left behind? He has as much cause to go to war as you. Why can he not fight for those he loves?
: Final Revision - October, 2003 66. CONTINUED:
THEODEN: I take my leave.
ARAGORN: My Lord, Elrond.
ELROND: I come on behalf of one whom I love.
: Final Revision - October, 2003 67. CONTINUED:
ARAGORN: She stayed?
ELROND: She will not long survive the evil that now spreads from Mordor.
ARAGORN: It will not be our end, but his.
ELROND: You ride to war, but not to victory. Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith - this you know - but in secret he sends another force which will attack from the river . . .
ARAGORN: There are none.
: Final Revision - October, 2003 68 CONTINUED:
ELROND: There are those who dwell in the mountain.
ARAGORN: Murderers, traitors - you would call upon them to fight? They believe in nothing. They answer to no-one.
ELROND: They will answer to the King of Condor.
ARAGORN: Sauron will not have forgotten the sword of Elendil . . .
: Final Revision - October, 2003 69. CONTINUED:
ELROND: The man who can wield the power of this sword can summon to him an army more deadly than any that walks this earth.
ARAGORN: U-chebin estel anim. I keep none for myself.
EOWYN: Why are you doing this?
ARAGORN: Eowyn . . .
: Final Revision - October, 2003 70. CONTINUED:
ARAGORN: Why have you come?
EOWYN: Do you not know?
ARAGORN: It is but a shadow and a thought that you love . . . I cannot give you what you seek.
GIMLI: And just where do you think you're off to?
ARAGORN: Not this time ... This time you must stay, my friend.
: Final Revision - October, 2003 71. CONTINUED:
GIMLI: You might as well accept it - we're going with you, laddie.
THEODEN: He leaves because he must.
THEODEN: No, we cannot . . . But we will meet them in battle, nonetheless.
THEODEN: I have left instruction: the people are to follow your rule in my stead ... take up my seat in the Golden Hall ... long may you defend Edoras if the battle goes ill.
EOWYN: What other duty would you have me do, my Lord?
THEODEN: Duty? ... No, I would have you smile again - not grieve for those whose time has come.
: Final Revision - October, 2003 73. CONTINUED:
GIMLI: What kind of an army would linger in such a place?
LEGOLAS: One that is cursed ... Long ago the Men of the Mountain swore an oath to the last King of Condor - to come to his aid, to fight, but when the time came, when Condor's need was dire, they fled ... Vanishing into the darkness of the mountain ... And so Isildur cursed them - never to rest until they had fulfilled their pledge.
GIMLI: The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away.
LEGOLAS: The way is shut. It was made by those who are dead, and the Dead keep it. The way is shut.
ARAGORN: Brego!
: Final Revision - October, 2003 74 CONTINUED:
GIMLI: Well, this is a thing unheard of ... An Elf will go underground when a Dwarf dare not. Oh! I ' d never hear the end of it!
THEODEN: We must ride light and swift. It's a long road ahead ... and man and beast must reach the end with the strength to fight.
: Final Revision - October, 2003 75, CONTINUED:
MERRY: All my friends have gone to battle. I would be ashamed to be left behind!
THEODEN: It is a three day gallop to Minas Tirith. None of my Riders can bear you as a burden.

KING OF THE DEAD: None but the King of Gondor may command me!
ARAGORN: It has been remade!
