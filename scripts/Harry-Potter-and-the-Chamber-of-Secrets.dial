HARRY: I can't, Hedwig. I'm not allowed to use magic outside of school. Besides, if Uncle Vernon -- At the sound of the name, HEDWIG SQUAWKS again, LOUDER.
UNCLE VERNON: Har-ry Pot-ter!
HARRY: Now you've done it.
UNCLE VERNON: I warned you. If you can't control that bloody bird, it'll have to go.
HARRY: She's bored. If I could just let her out for an hour or two --
UNCLE VERNON: And have you sending secret messages to your freaky little friends? No, sir.
: 
HARRY: But I haven't gotten any messages. From any of my friends. Not one. All summer.
DUDLEY: Who'd want to be friends with you?
UNCLE VERNON: I should think you'd be more grateful. We raise you since you were a baby, give you food off our table, even let you have Dudley's second bedroom... purely out of the goodness of our hearts.
DUDLEY: I thought he got the second bedroom because Mum was afraid he'd turn us into dung beetles if you put him back in the cupboard under the stairs. AUNT PETUNIA stops cold, exchanges a dark look with Uncle Vernon, then sees Dudley extending a finger for the pudding.
UNCLE VERNON: Which should be any moment. Now. Let's run through our schedule one more time. Petunia, when the Masons get here, you will be --
UNCLE VERNON: Good. And Dudley?
DUDLEY: I'll be waiting to open the door.
UNCLE VERNON: Excellent. And you?
: 
HARRY: I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I don't exist.
UNCLE VERNON: Too right you will. With any luck, this could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career. DOORBELL RINGS. Instantly, Uncle Vernon shoves Harry out of the kitchen and into the hallway.
UNCLE VERNON: Upstairs! Hurry!
DOBBY: Harry Potter! Such an honor it is!
: 
HARRY: What... Who are you?
DOBBY: Dobby, sir. Dobby the house elf.
HARRY: I see. Not to be rude or anything, but this isn't a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom.
DOBBY: Oh, yes, sir, Dobby understands. It's just that, Dobby has come to tell you... it is difficult, sir... Dobby wonders where to begin.
HARRY: Why don't you sit down?
DOBBY: S-s-sit down? Suddenly Dobby BURSTS INTO TEARS. LOUD TEARS. Harry panics.
HARRY: Shhhh! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you or anything --
DOBBY: Offend Dobby! Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but never has he been asked to sit down by a wizard, like an equal...
HARRY: You can't have met many decent wizards then. Dobby shakes his head, then without warning, LEAPS off the bed and starts to BANG HIS HEAD FURIOUSLY ON THE FLOOR.
DOBBY: Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!
: 
UNCLE VERNON: Don't mind that. It's just the... cat.
DUDLEY: Cat? What cat?
UNCLE VERNON: Our cat, tiger.
HARRY: Are you... all right?
DOBBY: Dobby had to punish himself, sir. Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir.
HARRY: Your... family?
DOBBY: The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. Dobby is bound to serve one family forever. If they ever knew Dobby was here... Dobby shudders in fear, then looks up, WHISPERS urgently.
DOBBY: But Dobby had to come. Dobby has to protect Harry Potter. To warn him. Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year.
HARRY: Not go back? But... I have to.
DOBBY: This is a plot. A plot to make most terrible things happen. If Harry Potter goes back to school he will be in great danger.
: 
HARRY: What terrible things? Who's plotting them?
HARRY: Okay! I understand. You can't say -- Too late. Dobby grabs the bedside lamp and starts beating himself about the head and YELPING LOUDLY.
UNCLE VERNON: They arrive at the ninth hole and -- DOBBY'S YELPS INTERRUPT, ringing out from above.
UNCLE VERNON: Not to worry. I'll sort it out.
HARRY: Stop! Stop! FOOTSTEPS THUNDER on the landing. Quickly, Harry grabs Dobby by the pillowcase and pitches him into the wardrobe... just as the door FLINGS OPEN.
UNCLE VERNON: What the devil are you doing up here! You've just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke. One more sound and you'll wish you'd never been born, boy! He stomps flat-footed from the room and SLAMS THE DOOR. Harry lets Dobby out of the wardrobe.
: 
HARRY: See why I've got to go back? I don't belong here. I belong in your world -- at Hogwarts. It's the only place I've got... friends.
DOBBY: Friends who don't even write to Harry Potter?
HARRY: Well, I expect they've been -- hang on, how do you know my friends haven't been writing me? Guiltily, Dobby takes out a STACK of LETTERS.
DOBBY: Harry Potter mustn't be angry with Dobby -- Dobby hoped if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him... Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir...
HARRY: Give me those. Now. Dobby frowns sadly, then DASHES out the door. Panicking...
HARRY: Dobby... Please... No...
DOBBY: Harry Potter must say he's not going back to school.
HARRY: I can't. Hogwarts is my home.
: 
DOBBY: Then Dobby must do it, sir. For Harry Potter's own good. Dobby SNAPS HIS FINGERS. The pudding PLUMMETS... straight onto the Masons. They stand blinking, covered head to foot with whipped cream and sugared violets. The Masons exit. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia race after them.
UNCLE VERNON: I'm sorry. It's our nephew. Very disturbed. Meeting strangers upsets him, so we kept him upstairs...
UNCLE VERNON: Go on. Read it.
HARRY: 'Dear Mr. Potter. We have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was used at your place of residence at twelve minutes past seven this evening. As you know, underage wizards...'
UNCLE VERNON: '... are not permitted to perform spells outside school.'
: 
: 
UNCLE VERNON: You didn't tell us you weren't Allowed to use magic at home. Slipped your mind, didn't it?
: 
: 
UNCLE VERNON: Well, I've got news for you, boy. I'm locking you up! And if you try to magic yourself out, they'll expel you! You're never going back to that school! Never!
DUDLEY: I know what day it is.
HARRY: Well done, Dudley. Finally learned the days of the week, have you.
DUDLEY: Today's your birthday. And nobody cares. Dudley SNAPS SHUT the flap. Harry sighs, takes the soup and a bit of stale bread, and crosses to Hedwig.
HARRY: It's no good turning your beak up. It's all we've got. Harry feeds a piece of bread to Hedwig... as we...
: 
HARRY: Ron?
RON: Hiya, Harry.
HARRY: Fred? George? What're you doing here?
RON: Rescuing you, of course. Where's your trunk?
RON: Stand back. Harry steps back. Ron turns, nods to Fred.
HARRY: Hedwig! Harry clambers back, grabs Hedwig's cage, swings it onto the ledge, when... BAM! The bedroom door CRASHES OPEN.
UNCLE VERNON: Petunia! He's getting away! As Harry leaps for the windowsill, Uncle Vernon CHARGES FORWARD and SNATCHES his ankle. Harry tumbles into the darkness, one hand gripping Hedwig's cage, the other reaching out and... CATCHING Ron's at the last possible second. Uncle Vernon puts both hands to Harry's ankle, pulls harder. Ron braces himself, pulls back. Harry hangs, stretched high over the lawn, directly above the mangled steel bars. CLOSEUP: Harry's hand begins to slip from Ron's fingers. INSIDE OF CAGE: Hedwig PECKS feverishly at the LOCK. CLOSE-UP: Ron. PANICKED.
RON: Hold on, Harry!
UNCLE VERNON: Oh no, boy! You and that bloody pigeon aren't going anywhere! CLOSE-UP: Harry's hand begins to slip away from Ron's. INSIDE OF CAGE: Hedwig PECKS HARDER and... the CAGE
RON: Put your foot down, Fred!
: 
RON: By the way, Harry. Happy Birthday.
RON: It's not much.
HARRY: I think it's... brilliant! Ron looks up. Sees Harry's mesmerized face. Slowly...
MRS. WEASLEY: 
: 
MRS. WEASLEY: Harry! How wonderful to see you. Beds empty! No note! You could've died! You could've been seen! I don't blame you, of course, dear.
RON: They were starving him, Mum! There were bars on his window!
MRS. WEASLEY: You best hope I don't put bars on your window, Ronald Weasley! Care for a spot of tea, Harry?
GINNY: Mummy. Have you seen my jumper -- A small, RED-HEADED GIRL appears. Sees Harry. And... SQUEALS. Dashes back up the stairs. Ron frowns.
RON: Ginny. Been talking about you all summer. Dead annoying, really.
MR. WEASLEY: What a night! Nine raids! Nine!
HARRY: Raids?
RON: Dad works at the Ministry of Magic. In the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office.
HARRY: The Misuse of Muggle Artefacts...?
: 
RON: That's when wizards bewitch something to drive Muggles mad. Shrinking door keys, that kind of thing. Dad loves Muggles. Thinks they're fascinating. Mr. Weasley hangs up his cloak, turns. Blinks.
MR. WEASLEY: Well now. Who are you?
RON: Harry, sir. Harry Potter.
MR. WEASLEY: Good Lord, are you really? Ron's told us all about you, of course. When did you get here?
MRS. WEASLEY: This morning. Your sons flew that enchanted car of yours to Surrey house and back last night.
MR. WEASLEY: Did you now! How'd it go?! I... I mean... That was very wrong, boys. Very wrong indeed. So, Harry. You must know all about Muggles. Tell me, what exactly is the function of a parking meter? Harry is about to answer, when he notices an OWL soaring toward the kitchen window. To Harry's horror, the owl doesn't pull up. It just flies... SMACK!... into the glass.
MRS. WEASLEY: That must be Errol with the post. Fetch him, will you, George? George takes the unconscious Errol, absently lays him on a draining board, and takes the LETTERS clutched in his claws.
: 
MR. WEASLEY: Dumbledore must know you're here, Harry. Doesn't miss a trick, that man.
MRS. WEASLEY: We'll manage. Right then. There's only one place to get all of this.
MRS. WEASLEY: You first, Harry dear. Mrs. Weasley offers Harry a FLOWERPOT. At the bottom is a layer of VERY SOFT DUST. Harry frowns in confusion.
RON: Harry's never traveled by Floo Powder before, Mum.
HARRY: Floo Powder? Just then, Ron's older brother PERCY enters.
MRS. WEASLEY: Percy. Would you mind going first, so Harry can see how it's done?
PERCY: Certainly, Mother. Don't worry, Harry. It's simple enough.
: 
PERCY: Diagon Alley. Percy VANISHES. Tentatively, Harry reaches into the pot.
MRS. WEASLEY: Remember to speak clearly, dear!
RON: And mind you get out at the right grate!
HARRY: D-Dia-gon Alley!
: 
MR. BORGIN: Mr. Malfoy! What a pleasure to see you again. If I may, just in today --
LUCIUS MALFOY: I'm not buying today, Mr. Borgin. But selling.
MR. BORGIN: Selling?
LUCIUS MALFOY: You have heard, of course, that the Ministry of Magic is conducting more raids. There are even rumors of a new Muggle Protection Act... Lucius unravels a roll of parchment, hands it to Borgin.
LUCIUS MALFOY: I have a few... ah... items at home that might prove embarrassing if the Ministry were to call. Certain poisons and the like...
MR. BORGIN: Hmmm... yes. I see... INSIDE THE CABINET, Harry realizes the walls are CLOSING IN. His eyes shift upward. The ceiling is DROPPING. Draco drifts to the Hand of Glory, reaches out, when... the HAND GRABS HIM. Draco shrieks, manages to slip free, then calms. He eyes the hand with malicious glee.
DRACO: Can I have this?
: 
MR. BORGIN: Ah, the Hand of Glory. Insert a candle and it gives light only to the holder. Best friend of thieves and plunderers. Your son has fine taste, sir.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Hopefully my son will amount to more than a thief, Mr. Borgin. Though if his marks don't pick up --
DRACO: It's not my fault the teachers have favorites. That Hermione Granger --
LUCIUS MALFOY: I would have thought you'd be ashamed that a girl of no wizarding family beat you in every exam.
MR. BORGIN: It's the same all over. Wizard blood is counting for less everywhere.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Not with me. INSIDE THE CABINET, Harry's knees are up under his chin... Borgin checks off one last time, then returns the parchment to Lucius. Satisfied, Malfoy nods.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Very good. I'll expect you at the manor tomorrow. Come, Draco. They exit. As Borgin slips into the back room, the Crushing Cabinet's doors FLY OPEN and Harry leaps free. Inside, the walls, floor, and ceiling SNAP SHUT! Borgin reappears, blinks curiously at Harry, then watches him RACE out the door.
: 
HARRY: I'm fine, thanks. I'm just --
HAGRID: HARRY! What d'yer think yer doin' down 'ere?
HARRY: Hagrid! Hagrid knocks the tray from the cursing Witch's hands, then seizes Harry by the scruff of the neck and steers him away.
HAGRID: Yer a mess! Skulkin' 'round Knockturn Alley. Dodgy place, Harry. Don't want no one ter see yeh down there. People'll be thinkin' yer up ter no good.
HARRY: I was lost, I -- Hang on. What were you doing down there?
HAGRID: I was lookin' fer a Flesh Eatin' Slug Repellent. They're ruinin' the school cabbages.
HERMIONE: Harry! Harry looks up, sees HERMIONE GRANGER standing at the top of Gringotts' white steps. She runs down to meet them.
: 
HERMIONE: Hello, Hagrid. Oh, it's wonderful to see you two again.
HERMIONE: Oculus Reparo. Instantly, Harry's glasses are mended.
HARRY: I need to remember that one.
HERMIONE: C'mon. Everyone's been so worried. Hermione leads them to Gringotts, where Hermione's rather nervous-looking Muggle parents stand with the Weasleys.
MR. WEASLEY: So you're dentists! Fascinating! I understand other Muggles quite fear you? Why is that?
MRS. WEASLEY: Oh, Harry. Thank goodness. We hoped you'd only gone one grate too far. Come now. We're off to Flourish and Blotts.
HERMIONE: Isn't it thrilling! Gilderoy Lockhart's going to be there! We can actually meet him! I mean, he's written almost the whole booklist! As Mrs. Weasley and Hermione dash off, Harry frowns.
HARRY: Who?
: 
MRS. WEASLEY: There he is!
RON: Mum fancies him. For this, Mrs. Weasley gives Ron a jab in the shoulder. A SHORT MAN WITH A CAMERA bumps past.
GILDEROY LOCKHART: It can't be Harry Potter? The crowd WHISPERS excitedly as Lockhart dives forward, seizes Harry's hand and turns him toward the photographer.
GILDEROY LOCKHART: Nice big smile, Harry. Together, you and I rate the front page. Ladies and gentlemen! What an extraordinary moment this is! When young Harry here stepped into Flourish and Blotts this morning to purchase my autobiography, Magical Me -- which, incidentally is celebrating its twenty-seventh week atop The Daily Prophet's Bestseller List -- he had no idea that he would, in fact, be leaving with my entire collected works! Free of charge!
: 
HARRY: Thank you. Slipping free, Harry drifts back into the crowd and, red with embarrassment, drops the books into Ginny's cauldron.
HARRY: You have these. I'll buy my own --
DRACO: Bet you loved that, didn't you, Potter? Famous Harry Potter. Can't even go into a bookshop without making the front page.
GINNY: Leave him alone! He didn't want all that!
DRACO: Look, Potter. You've got yourself a girlfriend!
: 
LUCIUS MALFOY: Silence, Draco! Ah... Mr. Potter. I don't believe we've met.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Forgive me, Mr. Potter. But your scar is legend. As, of course, is the wizard who gave it to you.
HARRY: He was a murderer.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Yes, a pity about your parents. Curious that you yourself should escape with a mere flesh wound. Curious, too, that you speak of him in the past. Surely, you don't think He-Who-Must-Not-Be- Named is gone forever.
HARRY: His name is Voldemort. Those within earshot gasp as Harry utters the word.
LUCIUS MALFOY: You must be very brave, Mr. Potter, to dare speak his name. Or foolish.
HERMIONE: Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself. Lucius Malfoy's eyes slide, find Hermione staring defiantly.
LUCIUS MALFOY: You must be Miss Granger. Draco's told me all about you... and your parents. Muggles, aren't you? Mr. and Mrs. Granger nod nervously. Lucius Malfoy can barely disguise his distaste for them. Arthur Weasley hurries over.
: 
MR. WEASLEY: Ron! Harry! It's mad in here. Let's go outside.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Well, well, well -- Arthur Weasley.
MR. WEASLEY: Lucius.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Busy time at the Ministry. All those raids. I hope they're paying you overtime. Malfoy reaches into Ginny's cauldron, removes a very old, battered copy of A Beginner's Guide to Transfiguration.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Obviously not. Dear me. What's the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don't even pay you well for it.
MR. WEASLEY: We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard, Lucius.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Clearly. The company you keep, Weasley. And I thought your family could sink no lower. Mr. Weasley moves to hit Lucius Malfoy. Hagrid steps forward, puts a firm hand on Mr. Weasley's shoulder.
HAGRID: Ignore 'im, Arthur. Mr. Weasley backs away. Lucius Malfoy tosses Ginny's BATTERED TEXTBOOK back into her cauldron.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Here, girl. Take your book. It's the best your father can give you. Lucius and Draco exit. Hagrid looks at the Weasleys.
: 
HAGRID: No Malfoy's worth listenin' ter. Rotten ter the core, the whole family...
MRS. WEASLEY: Oh dear! The train'll be leaving any moment! All together now! Hurrying, they race to PLATFORMS NINE AND TEN. Quickly, Percy, Fred and George stride briskly toward the stone barrier that divides the platforms -- and simply
MRS. WEASLEY: Go on, Ginny. You know what to do. Ginny, looking a bit nervous, rushes toward the barrier, closes her eyes, and sleds...
: 
MRS. WEASLEY: Come, Ginny. We'll get you a seat.
RON: We better hurry. Harry nods, leans into his trolley and -- CRASH! -- hits the barrier and bounces back into Ron. A GUARD glowers.
HARRY: Sorry. Lost control of the trolley. Why can't we get through?
RON: I dunno. The gateway's sealed itself for some reason. As Ron presses his ear to the barrier, the CLOCK CHIMES.
HARRY: The train leaves at exactly eleven o'clock. We've missed it.
RON: Can't hear a thing. Harry. If we can't get through, maybe Mum and Dad can't get back.
HARRY: Maybe we should go wait by the car.
RON: The car!
: 
HARRY: This is mad. We can't drive to Hogwarts.
RON: Who says we're driving?
HARRY: You don't mean -- Ron, no.
RON: Look, who knows when Mum and Dad will get back. And we've got to get to school, haven't we? And even underage wizards are allowed to use magic if it's an absolute emergency. Least that's what Fred and George always say...
HARRY: Something tells me we're going to regret this.
HARRY: No offense, Ron, but are you sure you know how to fly this.
RON: No problem. Ron SHIFTS. With a GREAT JOLT, the car lifts from the ground.
RON: There. See. Now I reckon all we have to do is find the Hogwarts Express and follow it. Simple. Harry nods, not entirely convinced. He peers out the window. Down below, TWO PEDESTRIANS stare in disbelief.
HARRY: Uh, Ron. I should tell you. Most Muggles aren't accustomed to seeing a flying car.
RON: Right. Ron presses a TINY SILVER BUTTON on the dashboard and they... DISAPPEAR. Down below, the baffled pedestrians blink.
RON: Uh oh. The Invisibility Booster must be faulty. CAMERA ZOOMS ALONG the ridge of a cliff. The car reappears from above, gliding away FROM CAMERA.
RON: Any sign of the train?
HARRY: There! Up ahead! Look... Along a STEEP BRIDGE, a single line of TRAIN TRACKS appear.
RON: Brilliant. Ron SHIFTS, GLIDES DOWN, until the Anglia is only a few feet above the tracks. The boys peer ahead, looking for the train.
RON: It must be around here someplace. Behind them, through the Anglia's rear window, the Hogwarts Express APPEARS, closing fast. Harry and Ron perk up. Smile.
HARRY: Do you hear that? Then, at precisely the same moment, Harry and Ron register the DIRECTION of the sound. They glance at each other, turn as one and see the train GROWING HUGE in the rear window.
: 
RON: Take my hand! Harry's grips Ron's hand, eyes the train steaming far below. It's quite a drop. Harry's fingers begin to LOSE
RON: Hold on!
HARRY: I'm trying! Your hand's all sweaty! Straining, Ron yanks him inside, levels off the car. As Harry falls heavily into his seat, he BUCKLES his safety belt.
HARRY: I think we found the train.
RON: Welcome home, Harry. Harry smiles at the sight of it, when... the Anglia
HARRY: Just out of interest, Ron. Have you ever landed a car before?
RON: Well... no. but, until a few hours ago, I'd never taken off in one either. With that, the car LURCHES, the nose DROPS, and...
RON: Uh oh.
: 
RON: 
HARRY: 
HARRY: 
HARRY: 
RON: 
RON: My wand! Look at my wand!
HARRY: Be thankful it's not your neck. THWUNMP! Something HEAVY HITS Harry's door, sends a SHUDDER through the car.
RON: What's happening? Slowly, they look up and, in disbelief, watch one of the tree's branches PULL BACK, CURL INTO ITSELF, and come LASHING FORWARD like a MASSIVE FIST. THWUMP!
: 
RON: What kind of tree is this? Before Harry can respond, the tree begins to PUMMEL THE CAR from all sides, tossing Henry and Ron about like popcorn. WINDOWS SHATTER. Heavy DENTS appear on the roof above Ron and Harry's heads. Then the car FALLS again... ... SLAMMING HEAVILY TO THE GROUND. Instantly, the tree's lower branches shoot through the front and rear windscreens and, gaining purchase, begin to SHAKE THE CAR
HARRY: Reverse! Reverse! Ron SHIFTS, the CAR SHOOTS BACKWARDS, and the willow PUMMELS THE TREAD-MARKED GROUND they just vacated. Safely clear, the doors fly open, the seats tip sideways, and Ron and Harry are ejected. As they hit the ground, their trunks fly from the boot, Hedwig's cage rockets out the back window, and Hedwig herself flaps into the night. Taillights blazing angrily, the BATTERED car speeds off, fishtailing into the Dark Forest.
RON: Dad's going to kill me. They hear a TREMENDOUS GROAN, turn back, and see the Whomping Willow assume its natural form, waiting for its next victim.
: 
HARRY: A house elf shows up in my bedroom, we can't get through the barrier to Platform Nine and Three Quarters, we almost get killed by a tree... clearly someone doesn't want me here this year.
FILCH: Well, take a good look, lads... They stop. ARGUS FILCH stands at the top of the landing, his cat -- MRS. NORRIS -- twitching her tail at his feet.
FILCH: This night might well be the last you spend in this castle.
: 
SNAPE: You were seen! By no less then seven Muggles. Do you have any idea how serious this is? You have risked the exposure of our world. Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow that has been on these grounds for hundreds of years.
RON: Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us.
SNAPE: Silence! I assure you, were you in Slytherin and your fate rested with me, the both of you would be on the train home tonight. As it is --
HARRY: Professor Dumbledore. Professor McGonagall...
SNAPE: Headmaster, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry. As such...
RON: We'll go and get our stuff. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley?
: 
RON: Well, you're going to expel us, aren't you?
DUMBLEDORE: Splendid. Now, I suggest we return to the feast. There's a delicious-looking custard tart I want to sample. Rising, Harry spies an ENVELOPE on the floor. Taking it, he reads the back: "KWIKSPELL. A CORRESPONDENCE COURSE IN BEGINNER'S MAGIC." It's addressed to "MR. ARGUS FILCH."
HARRY: Mr. Filch. You dropped this... Filch turns, eyes the envelope with embarrassment, then snatches it from Harry's hand and stuffs it into his pocket.
NEVILLE: Detention. On the first day?
SEAMUS: That must be some kind of record.
: 
HERMIONE: I should think you'd count yourself lucky that's all you got.
RON: I should think you'd mind your own business. They glare at each other. PROFESSOR SPROUT, a squat little witch, TAPS her wand on a stack of POTS.
PROFESSOR SPROUT: Welcome to Greenhouse Three, Second Years. Today, we will be re-potting Mandrakes. Now, who here can tell me the properties of the Mandrake? Yes, Miss Granger.
HERMIONE: Mandrake, or Mandragora, is used to return those who have been transfigured to their original state. It's also quite dangerous. The Mandrake's cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.
PROFESSOR SPROUT: Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor. As our Mandrakes are only seedlings, their cries won't kill yet. However, they will knock you out for several hours. That is why I have provided each of you with a pair of earmuffs. If you would then... Ron frowns. He's gotten a BRIGHT PINK FLUFFY pair. When the class is ready, Professor Sprout leads them to the GARDEN AREA. She grasps one of the TUFTY PLANTS before her... and pulls. Harry gasps. Instead of roots, a small, muddy, extremely ugly BABY pops out of the earth, leaves growing right out of its head. Neville's eyes ROLL BACK. He FAINTS. Professor Sprout plunges the BAWLING CREATURE deep into a POT, removes her earmuffs, and the others follow suit. Everyone save Neville, who lies stretched on the ground.
PROFESSOR SPROUT: Hm. Looks as though Mr. Longbottom neglected his muffs.
: 
SEAMUS: No, ma'am. He's just fainted.
PROFESSOR SPROUT: Very well. We'll just leave him then. Come now. Four to a tray, plenty of pots to go round...
PERCY: Hello, Sir Nicolas.
RON: Say it. I'm doomed.
HARRY: You're doomed. FLASH! -- a LIGHT BLINDS Harry. He blinks, finds a small boy standing before him with a CAMERA.
COLIN: Hiya, Harry. I'm Colin Creevey. I'm in Gryffindor too.
HARRY: Hello, Colin. Nice to meet --
COLIN: They're for my dad -- the pictures. He's a milkman, you know, a Muggle, like all our family's been until me. No one knew all the odd stuff I could do was magic till we got my letter from Hogwarts. Everyone just thought I was mental.
: 
RON: Imagine that.
COLIN: Say, Harry. D'you think your friend could take a photo of me and you standing together? Ya' know, to prove I've met you? Harry glances at Ron. He looks positively homicidal. Mercifully, just then, OWLS STREAM into the Hall.
RON: Bloody bird's a menace -- Oh... no.
SEAMUS: Heads up, everyone. Weasley's gotten himself a Howler.
: 
NEVILLE: Go on, Ron. I ignored one from my Gran once... and it was horrible.
MRS. WEASLEY: 
HARRY: Look at it this way. How much worse can things get?
GILDEROY LOCKHART: Let me introduce you to your new Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher. Me. Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League and five times winner of Witch Weekly's Most- Charming-Smile Award -- But I don't talk about that. I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at her! Lockhart awaits laughter. A few students smile weakly.
GILDEROY LOCKHART: I see you've all bought a complete set of my books. Well done. I thought we'd start today with a little quiz. Nothing to worry about. Just to check how well you've read them, how much you've taken in... Lockhart begins to circulate papers. Harry and Ron examine the questions. Ron WHISPERS to Harry.
RON: Look at these questions. They're all about him.
HARRY: 'What is Gilderoy Lockhart's favorite color?'
RON: 'What is Gilderoy Lockhart's greatest achievement to date?'
HARRY: 'When is Gilderoy Lockhart's birthday and what would his ideal gift be?'
GILDEROY LOCKHART: You have thirty minutes. Start -- now! As quills begin to dart across pages, we --
GILDEROY LOCKHART: Tut, tut. Hardly any of you remembered my favorite color is lilac. But Miss Hermione Granger knew that my secret ambition is to rid the world of evil and market my own range of hair care potions. Good girl. Hermione beams. Lockhart's expression suddenly darkens.
GILDEROY LOCKHART: Now... be warned! It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind! You may find yourself facing your own worst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here... With a showman's flair, Lockhart turns slowly to the cage.
GILDEROY LOCKHART: I must ask you not to scream. It might provoke them. A pale Neville draws back. Harry and Ron lean forward. Lockhart lets the tension build, then WHIPS off the cover. Inside the cage are several electric blue CREATURES. Eight inches tall, with pointed faces and wings, they rattle the bars and pull bizarre faces at the students.
SEAMUS: Cornish pixies?
GILDEROY LOCKHART: Freshly caught Cornish pixies. Unable to control himself, Seamus SNORTS with laughter.
GILDEROY LOCKHART: Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan, but pixies can be devilishly tricky little blighters. Let's see what you make of them now! Lockhart flings open the cage. Instantly, the pixies rocket about, spraying the students with ink bottles, BREAKING BEAKERS and shredding books. Two SEIZE Neville by the ears, lift him into the air, and begin to circle the ceiling.

GILDEROY LOCKHART: Come on now, round them up, round them up. They're only pixies. Peskipiski Pesternomi! The spell has absolutely no effect. A particularly obnoxious pixie makes a face, seizes Lockhart's wand and tosses it out the window. Lockhart joins the stampede to the door.
GILDEROY LOCKHART: I'll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage. SLAMMING the door, he's gone. Harry, Ron and Hermione stand blinking. Ron swats a pixie gnawing his ear.
RON: What do we do now?
HERMIONE: Immobilus! The pixies FREEZE IN MIDAIR. Neville falls, PLOPS onto Lockhart's desk, shaken but unhurt. He looks at Hermione.
NEVILLE: Why is it always me?
RON: Can you believe him?
HERMIONE: I'm sure Professor Lockhart just wanted to give us some hands-on experience.
HARRY: Hands on? Hermione, he didn't have a clue what he was doing.
: 
HERMIONE: Rubbish. Read his books. You'll see all the amazing things he's done.
RON: He says he's done.
WOOD: I spent the summer devising a whole new Quidditch program. We're going to train earlier, harder, and longer! What the... I don't believe it! Crossing the courtyard from the other side are SEVEN BOYS in GREEN ROBES, also carrying broomsticks. At their lead is MARCUS FLINT, trollish Slytherin Captain. Ron, sitting at a table with Hermione, looks up.
: 
RON: Uh-oh. I smell trouble.
WOOD: Clear out, Flint! I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
WOOD: 'I, Professor Severus Snape, do hereby give the Slytherin team permission to practice today, owing to the need to train their new Seeker.' You've got a new Seeker? Who? A pasty-faced boy pushes to the front. It's... Malfoy.
HARRY: Draco?
DRACO: That's right. And that's not all that's new this year... As one, the seven Slytherins hold out seven brand-new GLEAMING BROOMSTICKS. The Gryffindors look stunned.
RON: Those are Nimbus Two Thousand Ones.
DRACO: That's right, Weasley. You see, unlike some, my father can afford to buy the best.
HERMIONE: At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in. They got in on pure talent.
: 
DRACO: No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood.
WOOD: Save it for the match.
RON: You'll pay for that one, Malfoy! Eat slugs! Ron points his cracked wand at Malfoy. PFFT! -- a BOLT of GREEN LIGHT scissors out the wrong end, hitting Ron himself in the stomach. As he drops to the grass, Hermione runs to him
HERMIONE: Ron! Say something! Ron opens his mouth and... BELCHES. Hermione draws back, and watches a TRIO of SLUGS dribble out his mouth. The Slytherins CROW with LAUGHTER. Angrily, Ron rises, only to BELCH again. Fascinated, Colin Creevey runs up with his camera.
COLIN: Wow! Can you hold him still, Harry?!
HARRY: Get out of the way, Colin! Let's take him to Hagrid. He'll know what to do.
HAGRID: Got jus' the thing. Set 'im down on that chair o'er there. As Ron sits, Hagrid pitches a BUCKET between his knees. Harry and Hermione glance up questioningly. Hagrid shrugs.
: 
HAGRID: Better out than in. Who was he tryin' ter curse anyway?
HARRY: Malfoy. He called Hermione, well, I don't know exactly what it means...
HERMIONE: He called me a Mudblood.
HAGRID: He didn'! Harry looks confused. Hermione glances at him, then away, obviously pained by this.
HERMIONE: It means dirty blood. Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who was Muggle-born. Someone with non-magic parents. Someone... like me. It's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.
HAGRID: Yeh see, Harry. There are some wizards -- like Malfoy's family -- who think they're better than everyone else 'cause they're what people call pureblood.
HARRY: That's horrible.
RON: It's disgusting!
HAGRID: An' it's codswallop ter boot. Dirty blood. There's 'ardly a wizard today that's not half-blood or less. If we 'adn't married Muggles we'd've died out long ago. Besides, they haven't invented a spell our Hermione can't do... Don' you think on it, Hermione. Don' you think on it fer a minute.
GILDEROY LOCKHART: Harry, Harry, Harry... Can you possibly imagine a better way to serve detention than by helping me answer my fan mail? Harry forces a smile.
GILDEROY LOCKHART: Fame's a fickle friend, Harry. Celebrity is as celebrity does. Remember that. Harry nods, glancing gloomily at the towering stack of envelopes that remain. Dipping his quill, he starts to write, when... a CHILLY VOICE fills the room.
VOICE: Come... come to me...
: 
HARRY: What?
GILDEROY LOCKHART: I was saying, six solid months at the top of the bestseller list! Broke all records!
HARRY: No... not you, that... voice.
GILDEROY LOCKHART: Voice?
HARRY: That... voice. Didn't you hear it?
GILDEROY LOCKHART: What are you talking about, Harry? I think we're getting a bit drowsy. Great Scott -- and no wonder -- look at the time! We've been here nearly four hours! Dinner's nearly done! If you hurry you might make pudding. Spooky how the time flies when one's having fun!
HARRY: Spooky.
VOICE: Blood... I smell blood... Harry stops cold, looking around for the source of the voice.
VOICE: Let me rip you... let me kill you... Harry steps to the wall, playing his fingers along the stone, then begins walk, slowly at first, then more quickly, as if following something, moving faster and faster, rounding the corner and coming face to face with... Hermione and Ron.
: 
HERMIONE: Harry!
HARRY: Did you hear it?
RON: Hear what?
HARRY: That... voice.
HERMIONE: Voice? What voice?
HARRY: I heard it first in Lockhart's office and then again, just --
VOICE: Kill... Time to kill... As Harry stiffens, Hermione and Ron study him curiously.
HARRY: It's moving. I think it's going to... kill. Harry runs off. Hermione and Ron exchange a glance, follow.
: 
RON: Harry, what are you doing? He points. SHIMMERING on the wall are the words he saw reflected in water.
HERMIONE: 'The Chamber of Secrets has been opened...?'
RON: What's that? Hanging underneath?
HARRY: That's Filch's cat. Mrs. Norris. The cat hangs stiffly by her tail from a torch bracket, eyes open and blank. Harry's eyes shift to the adjacent WINDOW: near the topmost pane, SPIDERS scuttle up a silvery thread, fight to get through a crack in the glass.
HERMIONE: Look at that. Have you ever seen spiders act like that? Ron...?
RON: I... don't... like... spiders. Suddenly, the stairwell is alive with VOICES and, seconds later, dozens of students stream forth, CHATTERING... when they stop, seeing the wall and, standing before it, Harry, Ron and Hermione. A thudding SILENCE falls. Then Draco pushes forward, eyes the wall, and grins nastily.
DRACO: Enemies of the heir, beware! You'll be next, Mudbloods! Draco's eyes find Hermione, just as Filch appears.
FILCH: What's going on here? Go on now! Make way... Mrs. Norris! You! You've murdered my cat! I'll kill you! I'll --
: 
DUMBLEDORE: Argus! Dumbledore marches forward, trailed by a phalanx of teachers. Seeing the wall, Dumbledore's face darkens.
DUMBLEDORE: Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately. Everyone except you three. As the corridor empties, Dumbledore steps to the wall and, with extreme gentleness, removes Mrs. Norris.
GILDEROY LOCKHART: It was definitely a curse that killed her -- probably the Transmogrifian Torture. Encountered it myself once, in Ouagadougou. The full story's in my autobiography...
DUMBLEDORE: She's not dead, Argus. She's been Petrified.
GILDEROY LOCKHART: Precisely! So unlucky I wasn't there. I know the very countercurse that could have spared her...
DUMBLEDORE: But how she's been Petrified... I cannot say.
FILCH: Ask him! It's him that's done it. You saw what he wrote on the wall! Besides, he knows I'm -- I'm a Squib.
HARRY: It's not true, sir! I swear! I never touched Mrs. Norris -- And I don't even know what a Squib is.
FILCH: Rubbish! He saw my Kwikspell letter!
: 
SNAPE: If I might, Headmaster... The others turn, watch Snape separate from the shadows.
SNAPE: Perhaps Potter and his friends were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time... Could Snape be defending Harry and the others blink. them?
SNAPE: However, the circumstances are suspicious. I, for one, don't recall seeing Potter at dinner.
GILDEROY LOCKHART: I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus. You see, Harry was helping me answer my fan mail... As Snape's lip curls in disgust, Hermione leaps in.
HERMIONE: That's why Ron and I went looking for him, Professor. We'd just found him when Harry said...
SNAPE: Yes, Miss Granger?
HARRY: When I said I wasn't hungry. We were heading back to the Common Room and... found Mrs. Norris. Snape eyes Harry coldly, knowing he's lying. Harry looks away... and finds Dumbledore studying him as well.
DUMBLEDORE: Innocent until proven guilty.
FILCH: My cat has been Petrified! I want to see some punishment!
: 
DUMBLEDORE: We will be able to cure her, Argus. As I understand it, Madam Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrakes. When they have matured, a potion will be made which will revive Mrs. Norris. In the meantime, I advise caution. To all.
RON: A Squib's someone who's born into a wizarding family but hasn't got any powers of their own. It's why Filch is trying to learn magic from a Kwikspell course. It's also why he hates students so much. He's bitter. Hermione, who's only been half-listening -- as if trying to unravel something in her mind -- speaks then.
HERMIONE: Harry. This voice. You said you heard it first in Lockhart's office?
HARRY: Yes.
HERMIONE: And did he hear it?
HARRY: He said he didn't.
RON: Maybe he was lying.
HERMIONE: I hardly think someone with Gilderoy Lockhart's credentials would lie to one of his students, Ronald. Besides, if you recall, we didn't hear anything either.
: 
HARRY: You do believe me, don't you?
HERMIONE: 'Course we do. It's just... it's a bit weird, isn't it? You hear this voice and then... Mrs. Norris turns up Petrified.
HARRY: I can't explain it -- it was... scary. D'you think I should've told them -- Dumbledore and the others, I mean.
RON: Are you mad!
HERMIONE: No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign.
: 
HERMIONE: Professor, I was wondering if you could tell us about the Chamber of Secrets? A HUSH falls over the class. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL My subject is Transfiguration, Miss Granger.
HERMIONE: Yes, Professor. But there seems to be very little written about the Chamber of Secrets. For those of us with a personal interest in the subject, that is... disturbing. Malfoy regards Hermione with chilly amusement. McGonagall considers Hermione's question for a long moment, then nods. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Very well. You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age:
: 
: 
RON: Three glasses who? PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed that magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. In other words, purebloods. Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school. According to legend, Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle, known as the Chamber of Secrets. Shortly before departing, he sealed it until that time when his own true heir returned to the school. The heir alone would be able to open the Chamber of Secrets and unleash the horror within, and by so doing, purge the school of all those who, in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic.
HERMIONE: Muggle-borns. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Yes. Naturally, the school has been searched many times for such a chamber. It has never been found.
HERMIONE: Professor, what exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber? PROFESSOR McGONAGALL The Chamber is said to be home to something which the heir of Slytherin alone can control. It is said to be home... to a monster. Ron's eyes shift. Malfoy sits calmly, smiling to himself.
RON: D'you think it's true? D'you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?
HERMIONE: Yes. Couldn't you tell: McGonagall's worried. All the teachers are.
HARRY: But if there really is a Chamber of Secrets, and it's really been opened, that means...
HERMIONE: The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?
RON: Let's think. Who do we know who thinks Muggle-borns are scum.
HERMIONE: If you're talking about him --
RON: Of course! You heard him: 'You'll be next, Mudbloods'!
HERMIONE: I heard him. But Malfoy? The Heir of Slytherin?
HARRY: Maybe Ron's right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family. The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries.
RON: Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe we could trick them into telling...
: 
HERMIONE: No. Even they aren't that thick. But there might be another way. Mind you, it would be difficult. Not to mention we'd be breaking about fifty school rules. And it would be dangerous. Very dangerous.
RON: When do we start?
HERMIONE: Here it is: 'The Polyjuice Potion. Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another...'
RON: You mean, Harry and I drink some of this stuff and we turn into Crabbe and Goyle?
HERMIONE: Yes.
RON: Wicked! Malfoy'll tell us anything!
HERMIONE: Exactly. But it's tricky. I've never seen a more complicated potion. Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed. And, of course, we'll need a bit of whoever we want to change into too.
RON: Hang on now. I'm drinking nothing with Crabbe's toenails in it.
: 
HARRY: How long will it take to make?
HERMIONE: A month.
HARRY: A month? But if Malfoy is the heir of Slytherin... he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then.
HERMIONE: You didn't have to tell me that.
HAGRID: Gallopin' Gorgons! Slytherin's flyin' like they got dragon fire in their brooms... Ron fumes, looking as though he takes Slytherin's dominance personally. Taking Hagrid's GIANT BINOCULARS, he trains them on the FACULTY BOX -- where Lucius Malfoy sits next to Snape. Harry circles high above the pitch, searching for the Golden Snitch. Suddenly, Malfoy streaks by overhead.
DRACO: All right there, Scarhead? Harry turns, eyes Malfoy malevolently. Behind him, a BLUDGER drops INTO FRAME, begins to streak toward his head.
: 
HAGRID: Blimey, Harry's got 'imself a Rogue Bludger!
RON: Rogue Bludger?
HAGRID: Look fer yerself! It's bin' tampered with! Harry executes a series of zigs, zags, loops and rolls, trying to shake the Bludger, but the Bludger is relentless. Ron instinctively draws his wand, begins to point it toward Harry and the Bludger, when... Hermione's hand intercedes. She glances knowingly at his fractured wand.
HERMIONE: You're joking, right? Besides, even with a proper wand, it's too risky. You could hit Harry. As Harry frantically dips and dives, Malfoy cruises by.
DRACO: Training for the ballet, Potter? Harry glances at Malfoy's sneering face. BUZZING inches above Malfoy's left ear is... the GOLDEN SNITCH. Harry CHARGES. Malfoy GULPS, swings clear, and watches Harry rocket past. As Harry chases the plummeting Snitch, Malfoy FOLLOWS IN HOT PURSUIT. They RACE DOWNWARD, trailing the HISSING SNITCH deep into the TRENCH circling the pitch. Shoulder to shoulder, they RACE MADLY, driving and dodging the wooden support beams that crisscross their path. Directly behind them, the Bludger FOLLOWS, SHATTERING the BEAMS as it dogs Harry. Malfoy KICKS Harry, forcing him to the edge of the trench. Harry BRUSHES the wall, battling for control. Malfoy turns, SNICKERS, then looks back... and finds himself heading smack into a wooden beam. Panicked, he tries to pull up. Too late. Broom meets beam and Malfoy spirals out of the trench and -- THWUMP! -- flat on his back in the middle of the pitch.
: 
HERMIONE: Finite Incantatem! The Bludger hangs briefly in the air. Slowly ceases spinning. Drops heavily to the pitch. Harry exhales, relieved, only to recall the searing pain in his arm. As CONCERNED FACES swim above him, one particular face pushes through the others:
GILDEROY LOCKHART: Not to worry, Harry. I'll fix that arm of yours straight away.
HARRY: No... no... not you.
: 
GILDEROY LOCKHART: Poor boy doesn't know what he's saying. This won't hurt a bit...
GILDEROY LOCKHART: Ah. Yes. Well, that can sometimes happen. The point is, the bones are no longer broken.
HAGRID: Brok'n? He doesn't 'ave any bones at all! Harry looks: his arm looks like an empty rubber glove.
MADAM POMFREY: He should have been brought straight to me! I can mend bones in a heartbeat -- but growing them back --
HERMIONE: You will be able to, won't you?
MADAM POMFREY: I'll be able to, certainly, but it will be painful. You're in for a rough night, Potter. Regrowing bones is nasty business. Harry takes the steaming cup and drinks. Grimaces.
MADAM POMFREY: Well, what did you expect -- pumpkin juice? FLASH! Harry blinks, sees Colin Creevey standing there.
: 
COLIN: That was brilliant today, Harry! Brilliant!
MADAM POMFREY: Out! All of you! This boy's got thirty-three bones to regrow!
HARRY: Dobby!
DOBBY: Harry Potter came back to school. Dobby warned him. Harry Potter should have listened to Dobby. Harry Potter should have gone back home when he missed the train.
HARRY: It was you! You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through!
DOBBY: Indeed yes, sir. Dobby hid and watched for Harry Potter and sealed the gateway.
HARRY: You nearly got Ron and me expelled!
: 
DOBBY: At least you would be away from here. Harry Potter must go home! Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make Harry Potter see --
HARRY: Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me?
: 
DOBBY: Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir. Dobby had to iron his hands...
HARRY: You'd better clear off before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you!
DOBBY: Dobby is used to death threats, sir. Dobby gets them five times a day at home.
HARRY: I don't suppose you could tell me why you're trying to kill me?
DOBBY: Not kill you, sir, never kill you! Dobby remembers how it was before Harry Potter triumphed over He Who Must Not Be Named. We house elves were treated like vermin, sir. Of course, Dobby is still treated like vermin... Dobby HONKS his nose on the filthy pillowcase he wears.
HARRY: Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?
DOBBY: This, sir? 'Tis a mark of the house elf's enslavement. Dobby can only be freed if his master presents him with clothes. The family is careful not to pass Dobby so much as a sock, sir, for then he would be free to leave their house forever. Dobby's ears QUIVER, detecting... FOOTSTEPS. He
DOBBY: Terrible things are about to happen at Hogwarts! Harry Potter must not stay here now that history is to repeat itself!
: 
HARRY: Repeat itself? You mean, this has happened before?
HARRY: Tell me, Dobby? When did this happen before? Who's doing it now?
DOBBY: Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby only wants Harry Potter to be safe.
HARRY: Who is it? No, Dobby! Tell me! CRACK! Dobby is gone. SHADOWS flicker beyond the CURTAIN encircling Harry's bed. Harry slumps down... peers through a slit in the curtains. Dumbledore, in a nightcap, and McGonagall, in a tartan robe, heave a SMALL STATUE onto an empty bed. Seconds later, Madam Pomfrey bustles in.
MADAM POMFREY: What's happened?
DUMBLEDORE: There's been another attack. Madam Pomfrey GASPS. It is not a statue lying there. It is Colin Creevey, CAMERA still clutched to his eye. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Perhaps he managed to get a picture of his attacker... Dumbledore opens the camera. A JET OF STEAM HISSES forth. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL What does this mean, Albus?
DUMBLEDORE: It means our students are in great danger, Minerva. Mr. Creevey was fortunate. If not for this... He would surely be dead.
: 
DUMBLEDORE: Tell them the truth. Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe. Tell them it's as we feared. The Chamber of Secrets is indeed open again.
HERMIONE: Again? You mean, the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?
RON: Of course! Don't you see? Lucius Malfoy must've opened it when he was at school here, and now he's told Draco how to do it.
HERMIONE: Maybe. We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.
RON: Enlighten me. Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight, in the middle of a girls' lavatory? Don't you think we'll get caught?
HERMIONE: Never. No one over comes in here.
RON: Why?
HERMIONE: Moaning Myrtle.
RON: Who's Moaning Myrtle? There is a LOUD, PIERCING SCREECH, and the GHOST OF A
MOANING MYRTLE: I'm Moaning Myrtle. I wouldn't expect you to know me. Who would ever talk about fat, ugly, miserable, moping, moaning Myrtle? Myrtle SOBS LOUDLY, DIVES head first into the toilet.
HERMIONE: She's a little sensitive.
GILDEROY LOCKHART: Gather round! Gather round! Can everyone see me? Can you all hear me? Excellent. In light of the dark events of recent weeks, Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little Dueling Club, to train you all up in case you ever need to defend yourselves as I myself have done on countless occasions -- for full details, see my published works. The boy next to Harry, JUSTIN-FINCH FLETCHLEY, turns to him.
HARRY: Nice to meet you. I'm --
GILDEROY LOCKHART: Let me introduce my assistant Professor Snape. He has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration. Now I don't want any of you youngsters to worry. You'll still have your Potions Master when I'm through with him, never fear!
RON: What's the fun in that? Lockhart and Snape face each other and bow. They turn, walk ten paces, then... SPIN... wands poised like swords.
: 
GILDEROY LOCKHART: As you can see, we are holding our wands in the accepted combative position. On the count of three, we will cast our first spells. Neither of us will be aiming to kill, of course.
HARRY: I wouldn't bet on that.
GILDEROY LOCKHART: One-two-three --
SNAPE: Expelliarmus! A dazzling flash of SCARLET LIGHT bursts forth and BLASTS Lockhart off his feet and into the wall behind.
HERMIONE: Do you think he's all right?
GILDEROY LOCKHART: Well, there you have it. That was a Disarming Charm. As you see, I've lost my wand.
GILDEROY LOCKHART: Ah, thank you, Miss Granger. Yes, an excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape, but if you don't mind my saying so, it was very obvious what you were about to do. If I had wanted to stop you it would have been only too easy...
SNAPE: Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly spells, Professor.
: 
GILDEROY LOCKHART: An excellent suggestion, Professor Snape. Let's have a volunteer pair. Potter, Weasley, how about you?
SNAPE: Weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells. We'll be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox. Might I suggest someone from my own house. Malfoy, perhaps. Malfoy and Harry eye each other malevolently as they take their places onstage. Grudgingly, they bow to each other.
DRACO: Scared, Potter?
HARRY: You wish. They turn, walk ten paces, then WHIRL, wands poised.
GILDEROY LOCKHART: Wands at the ready! When I count to three, cast your charms to disarm your opponent -- only to disarm. We don't want any accidents. One, two -- Malfoy FIRES early, knocking Harry off his feet with a BLAST of WHITE LIGHT. He jumps up, points his wand.
HARRY: Rictusempra! A jet of SILVER LIGHT hits Malfoy dead in the stomach. He doubles up, WHEEZING.
GILDEROY LOCKHART: I said disarm only!
DRACO: Serpensortia! To Harry's horror, the tip of Malfoy's wand EXPLODES and a LONG BLACK SNAKE SLITHERS forth. Snape smiles with amusement.
: 
SNAPE: Don't move, Potter. I'll get rid of it for you.
GILDEROY LOCKHART: Allow me! Lockhart flicks his wand. BANG! The SNAKE flies into the air, HISSES in rage, and slithers straight towards Justin Finch-Fletchley. As students SCREAM, Harry -- oddly calm -- approaches the snake. It rises, fangs exposed, poised to strike Justin.
HARRY: Leave him! The snake looks into Harry's eyes, then turns for Justin.
HARRY: 
RON: Come on. Move. Now.
RON: You're a Parselmouth! Why didn't you tell us?
: 
HARRY: I'm a what?
HERMIONE: You can talk to snakes.
HARRY: I know. I mean, I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once. But so what? I bet loads of people here can do it.
HERMIONE: No. They can't. It's not a very common gift, Harry. This is bad.
HARRY: What's bad? If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin --
RON: Oh, that's what you said to it.
HARRY: You were there! You heard me!
RON: I heard you speaking Parseltongue. Snake language.
HARRY: I spoke a different language? But I didn't realize -- how can I speak a language without knowing I can?
HERMIONE: I don't know, Harry. But it sounded like you were egging the snake on or something. It was... creepy. As Gryffindors stream into the room, they eye Harry warily. Even Seamus, Neville, and Dean Thomas walk by without a word.
HERMIONE: Harry, listen out me. There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin house is a serpent. Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth. He could talk to snakes too.
: 
RON: Exactly. And now the whole school's going to think you're his great-great-great grandson or something.
HARRY: But I'm not. I... can't be.
HERMIONE: He lived a thousand years ago. For all we know... you could be.
HARRY: Who am I, Hedwig? What am I?
: 
HAGRID: All righ', Harry?
HARRY: Hagrid... what're you doing here?
: 
HAGRID: Second one killed this term. Reckon it's either foxes or a Blood-Suckin' Bugbear. Need Dumbledore's permission ter put a charm round the hen-coop. Yeh sure yeh're all righ', Harry? Yeh look all hot an' bothered.
HARRY: It's nothing. I'd better get going. I've got a lot of studying...
HARRY: Professor, I swear I didn't -- PROFESSOR McGONAGALL This is out of my hands, Potter. Mr. Filch, will you take care of this, please? Harry's eyes shift. Filch lurks in the shadows beyond McGonagall. He steps forward, HISSES QUIETLY.
FILCH: Caught in the act. I'll have you out this time, Potter. Mark my words... As McGonagall leads Harry away, he looks back. Filch stares at Justin and Nick, then turns. CAMERA DOLLYS
: 
FILCH: Dark magic. That's what you've got, Potter. Even the air you breathe comes out poison. You're evil. Evil as they come...
HARRY: Well, you see, I was wondering...
: 
HARRY: You're wrong! The hat sits motionless. Silent. Hearing a GAGGING SOUND, Harry wheels, finds an OLD, DECREPIT BIRD sitting on a GOLDEN PERCH. It wobbles, then... BURSTS INTO FLAMES. As Dumbledore enters, Harry looks horror- struck.
HARRY: Professor, your bird... I couldn't do anything... He just caught fire.
DUMBLEDORE: About time too. He's been looking dreadful for days. Pity you had to see him on a Burning Day. He's really very handsome most of the time. Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. Phoenixes burst into flame when it is time for them to die and are reborn from the ashes. Harry looks to the floor. The ASHES swirl. A baby Fawkes pokes out his wrinkled head, blinking through the dust.
DUMBLEDORE: Fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, their tears have healing powers, and they make highly faithful pets. Just then, Hagrid -- still clutching the dead rooster -- BURSTS through the door.
HAGRID: It wasn't Harry, Professor Dumbledore!
: 
DUMBLEDORE: Hagrid --
HAGRID: I was talkin' ter 'im jus' before that kid was found. It can't've bin 'im!
DUMBLEDORE: Hagrid --
HAGRID: I'll swear ter it in front o' the Ministry o' Magic --
DUMBLEDORE: HAGRID! I do not think that Harry has attacked anyone.
HAGRID: Oh. Right. I'll wait outside then. As Hagrid exits, Harry looks hopefully at Dumbledore.
HARRY: You don't think it was me, Professor?
DUMBLEDORE: No, Harry. But I must ask you... is there anything you'd like to tell me. Anything at all? Dumbledore waits. Harry debates. Finally...
HARRY: No, Professor. Nothing.
: 
RON: Oh, c'mon, Harry. Fred's just having a laugh.
HARRY: He's the only one.
RON: Okay, so half the school thinks you're nipping off to the Chamber of Secrets every night. Who cares?
HARRY: Maybe they're right.
HERMIONE: Harry!
HARRY: I didn't know I could speak Parseltongue. What else don't I know about myself? Maybe you can do something... even something horrible... and not know you did it.
HERMIONE: You don't believe that, Harry, I know you don't. And if it makes you feel better, I just heard Malfoy's staying over for holiday, too.
RON: Why would that make anyone feel better?
HERMIONE: Because, in a few days, the Polyjuice Potion's will be ready. In a few days... we may truly know who is the Heir of Slytherin.
: 
HERMIONE: Everything's set. We just need a bit of who you're changing into.
HARRY: Crabbe and Goyle.
HERMIONE: And we also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogating Malfoy.
RON: How? Hermione holds up a pair of SMALL CAKES.
HERMIONE: I've got it all worked out. I've filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. Simple, but powerful. Ron glances at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who presently are eating everything in front of them.
HERMIONE: You know how greedy Crabbe and Goyle are. They won't leave the Christmas Feast until every last drop of trifle is gone.
: 
: 
HERMIONE: Now, once they're asleep, hide them in a broom cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs.
RON: And whose hair are you ripping out?
HERMIONE: I've already got mine. She removes a SMALL VIAL. Inside is a TINY HAIR.
HERMIONE: Millicent Bulstrode. She's in Slytherin. I got this off her robes. All right then... I'm going to check on the Polyjuice Potion. Hermione points to the cakes in front of her.
HERMIONE: Remember. Just make sure Crabbe and Goyle find these. Hermione exits. Ron looks at Harry.
RON: Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go wrong?
: 
HERMIONE: Did you get it? Harry and Ron hold up their hands. In each: a TUFT OF HAIR. Hermione points to a pair of SLYTHERIN ROBES.
HERMIONE: I sneaked those out of the laundry. Harry and Ron nod, glance at the cauldron. The potion resembles a thick, dark, bubbling mud.
: 
HERMIONE: I'm sure I've done everything right. It looks like the book said it should. Once we've drunk it, we'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves.
RON: Now what?
HERMIONE: We separate it into three glasses and add the hairs. Harry and Ron grimace.
RON: Ugh. Essence of Crabbe... They nod. DRINK. Ron swallows grimly, doubles over.
RON: Think I'm gonna be sick... He runs into a stall. Harry looks sick, steps to a CRACKED MIRROR. Hermione pauses. Looks worried. Something's wrong... INSIDE THE STALL: Ron bends over the toilet, watches his reflection morph into Crabbe. IN THE CRACKED MIRROR: Harry watches his face contort into the thick features of Goyle. Hermione looks at her arm. Patches of fur begin to spread across her wrist and hand. Terrified, she RUNS into a stall. Ron emerges from his stall, a dead ringer for Crabbe.
: 
RON: Harry?
HARRY: Ron?
RON: Bloody hell.
HARRY: We still sound like ourselves. You need to sound more like Crabbe.
RON: Bloody hell.
HARRY: Lower.
RON: Bloody hell.
HARRY: Less intelligent.
RON: Bloody hell.
HARRY: Excellent.
RON: Hey... Where's Hermione?
HERMIONE: I -- I don't think I'm going. You go on without me.
HARRY: Hermione, are you okay?
HERMIONE: Just go! You're wasting time!
RON: Don't swing your arms like that. Crabbe holds them sort of stiff. Harry goes a bit more "Neanderthal."
RON: Yeah. That's better.
RON: What are you doing here? Percy squints, confused by Ron's voice. Harry elbows Ron, who clears his throat and speaks in a lower voice.
RON: What are you doing here?
PERCY: I happen to be a prefect. You, on the other hand, have no business wandering the corridors at night. It's not safe these days. Harry and Ron NOD, afraid to speak. Percy squints again.
PERCY: What're your names again?
DRACO: Crabbe. Goyle. Where have you been? Pigging out in the Great Hall all this time? Draco is walking towards them, glances witheringly at Percy.
DRACO: And what are you doing down here, Weasley?
PERCY: Mind your attitude, Malfoy. You want to show a little bit more respect to a school Prefect!
: 
DRACO: Come on, boys. Weasley thinks he's going to catch Slytherin's hair single-handed.
DRACO: Listen to this... Draco grabs The Daily Prophet, reads the front page.
DRACO: 'Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office, was today fined fifty Galleons for bewitching a Muggle car. "Weasley has brought the Ministry into disrepute," said Lucius Malfoy, a governor of Hogwarts. "He is clearly unfit to draw up our laws and his ridiculous Muggle Protection Act should be scrapped immediately."' Grinning, Malfoy glances over the paper at Harry and Ron.
DRACO: Arthur Weasley loves Muggle so much he should snap his wand in half and go join them. You'd never know the Weasleys were purebloods, the way they behave. Embarrassment to the wizarding world. All of them. Ron growls. Harry elbows him. Draco looks surprised.
DRACO: What's up with you, Crabbe?
RON: Stomachache.
: 
DRACO: Well, go to the hospital wing and give all those Mudbloods a kick in the arse for me! You know, I'm surprised The Daily Prophet hasn't reported all these attacks yet. I suppose Dumbledore's trying to hush it all up. He'll be sacked if it doesn't stop soon. Father always said Dumbledore's the worst thing that's ever happened to this place.
HARRY: You're wrong!
DRACO: What? Did you say that I was wrong? You think there's someone here who's worse than Dumbledore? Ron stiffens. Worried. Harry thinks, then:
HARRY: Harry Potter.
DRACO: Good one, Goyle. You're absolutely right. Saint Potter. He's another one with no proper wizard feeling, or he wouldn't go around with that Mudblood Granger. And people actually think he's the Heir of Slytherin. Harry and Ron exchange a glance. Harry leans closer to Draco.
HARRY: Then you must have some idea who's behind it all?
DRACO: You know I haven't, Goyle. How many times do I have to tell you? But my father did say this much: It's been fifty years since the Chamber was opened. He wouldn't tell me who opened it -- only that they were expelled -- but I know this: the last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died.
: 
: 
DRACO: So it's only a matter of time before one of them's killed this time. As for me... I hope it's Granger. As Malfoy grins, Ron's fist rises... when Harry stops him.
DRACO: What's the matter with you two? You're acting very... odd.
RON: Ho! Harry turns, sees Ron staring wide-eyed: Harry's SCAR is beginning to surface beneath the skin of Goyle's thick forehead. And Crabbe's hair is... turning RED. They both JUMP to their feet, DASHING out of the room.
DRACO: Hey! Where are you going?
RON: That was close!
HARRY: Hermione, come out. We've got loads to tell you!
HERMIONE: Go away!
: 
MOANING MYRTLE: Ooh, wait till you see. It's awful! The stall's lock slides back. The door opens slowly.
HERMIONE: Do you remember me telling you the Polyjuice Potion was only for human transformations...? Even in shadow, they can see: Hermione's face is covered in FUR, her eyes YELLOW, and POINTED EARS poke through her hair.
HERMIONE: It was cat hair I plucked off Millicent Bulstrode's robes! Look at my face!
RON: Look at your tail.
HERMIONE: Oh, good. Put those anywhere. They look. There is no anywhere. So they just... drop them.
RON: Madam Pince asked that we relay a message to you, Hermione: She'd appreciate it if you'd leave a few books for the rest of the school.
HERMIONE: I've got to keep up, haven't I? Just then, Hermione's tail twitches INTO VIEW.
RON: Is that thing ever going away?
: 
HERMIONE: Any day now, according to Madam Pomfrey. I'm just thankful I've stopped coughing up fur balls.
RON: We all are, believe me.
HERMIONE: Now. What about the Chamber of Secrets? Any new leads?
HARRY: Nothing.
HERMIONE: And has it gotten any better? I mean... is anyone speaking to you?
HARRY: Neville asked to borrow a tubeworm in Potions yesterday. I suppose that's something. Ron takes a GET-WELL CARD from under Hermione's pillow.
RON: 'To Miss Granger. Wishing you a speedy recovery, from your concerned teacher Gilderoy Lockhart.' You sleep with this under your pillow?
HERMIONE: Of course not. I don't know how that got there. Now go. I still have six hundred pages to read in Transformation Through the Ages.
RON: I know Hermione's mental, but can you believe she falls for that smarmy nonsense of Lockhart's?
: 
HARRY: Looks like Myrtle's flooded the bathroom. As Harry sploshes off toward the bathroom, Ron steps lightly.
RON: Yuck.
: 
MOANING MYRTLE: Come to throw something else at me?
HARRY: Why would I throw something at you?
MOANING MYRTLE: Don't ask me. Here I am, minding my own business, and someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at me...
RON: But it can't hurt if someone throws something at you. I mean, it'd just go right through you, wouldn't it?
MOANING MYRTLE: Oh sure! Let's all throw books at Myrtle, because she can't feel it! Ten points if you can get it through her stomach. Fifty points if it goes through her head!
HARRY: Who threw it at you anyway?
MOANING MYRTLE: I don't know. I didn't see them. I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death and it fell through the top of my head. Harry sees a SMALL BLACK BOOK on the floor. Picks it up.
RON: Fifty points if you can get it through her nose.
MOANING MYRTLE: 
HARRY: This is a diary. And it's old...
: 
RON: It's a diary, it's old... and was most recently in a toilet, Harry.
RON: Are you mad? That could be cursed. Dad once told me about a book the Ministry confiscated that burned the eyes out of anyone who tried to read it.
HARRY: I'll take my chances... Ahhh! MY EYES! MY EYES! Ron freezes, terrified, when... Harry grins, ending the ruse. At the end of corridor, Ginny stands, looking from the diary to Harry -- utter terror on her face -- then dashes off.
HARRY: Ginny! I was only joking -- Brilliant. Even your sister thinks I'm the monster now.
RON: Who doesn't? Ron frowns suddenly. On the first page on the diary, EMBOSSED LETTERS spell out a name: TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE.
RON: Tin Marvolo Riddle? Hang on. I know that name... Of course! The night I had detention... My job was to polish the silver in the trophy room. I remember because I kept burping slugs all over Tom Riddle's trophy. I must have wiped slime off his name for an hour. Harry fans the pages. They're empty.
HARRY: That's odd. He never wrote in it.
: 
HERMIONE: Tom Riddle... Hm. And Ron said he won an award fifty years ago?
HARRY: Special Services to the School or something --
HERMIONE: Fifty years ago? You're sure?
HARRY: Yes. Why?
HERMIONE: Don't you remember what Malfoy told you? The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened was --
HARRY: Fifty years ago! That means --
HERMIONE: Tom Riddle was here, at Hogwarts, when it happened. What if he wrote about what he saw? It's possible he knew where the Chamber was, how to open it, even what sort of creature lives in it. If so, whoever's behind the attacks this time wouldn't want a diary like this lying around, would they?
HARRY: That's a brilliant theory, Hermione. With just one tiny little flaw. There's nothing written in this diary.
HERMIONE: It might be invisible ink. Aparecium! She taps the diary three times. Nothing happens. The pages remain BLANK. She frowns, passes the book back to Harry.
: 
HERMIONE: I don't know, Harry. But I think you should be careful with this. Something tells me Ron might be right. It could be dangerous.
HARRY: You don't think I'm dangerous, do you, Hermione? I mean, you're not scared. Of me.
HERMIONE: I'm scared, Harry. But not of you.
HARRY: Do... you... know... anything... about... the... Chamber... of... Secrets? Yes.
HARRY: Can... you... tell... me? No.
: 
HARRY: Excuse me. Could you tell me where I am? Hello...? The boy doesn't respond, eyes staked to the activity in the adjoining room... which Harry sees now is the Entrance Hall. A group of ELDER WITCHES and WIZARDS -- Hogwarts Professors -- talk amongst themselves, then... abruptly go silent. Make way for two YOUNG WIZARDS, bearing a STRETCHER.
VOICE: Riddle. The boy wheels... and looks right through Harry. Harry turns, too. It's Dumbledore... fifty years younger.
TOM RIDDLE: Professor Dumbledore.
DUMBLEDORE: It's not wise to be wandering around this late, Tom.
: 
TOM RIDDLE: Yes, Professor. I suppose I -- I just had to see for myself, if...
TOM RIDDLE: ... the rumors were true.
DUMBLEDORE: I'm afraid they are, Tom.
TOM RIDDLE: About the school as well? They wouldn't really close Hogwarts, would they, Professor?
DUMBLEDORE: Headmaster Dippet may have no choice, I'm afraid.
TOM RIDDLE: Sir? If it all stopped. If the person responsible was caught...
DUMBLEDORE: Is there something you wish to tell me, Tom?
TOM RIDDLE: No, sir. Nothing. Dumbledore studies Riddle for a moment.
DUMBLEDORE: Very well then. Hurry along. Dumbledore strides directly past Harry, not seeing him. When he is gone, Riddle moves quickly, toward the dungeon steps.
: 
VOICE: C'mon, Aragog. Gotta get yeh outta here... C'mon now.. in the box...
TOM RIDDLE: Evening, Hagrid. Hagrid SLAMS the door shut.
TOM RIDDLE: I'm going to have to turn you in, Hagrid. I don't think you meant it to kill anyone --
TOM RIDDLE: Hagrid. The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered.
: 
HARRY: Ron! Ron!
RON: What? What's happened...?
HARRY: It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago.
HERMIONE: It can't be Hagrid. It just can't be.
RON: We don't even know this Riddle. He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch to me.
HARRY: The monster had killed someone, Ron. What would any of us done?
HERMIONE: Look. Hagrid's our friend. Why don't we just go ask him about it?
: 
RON: That'd be a cheerful visit. Hullo, Hagrid. Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?
HAGRID: Mad an' hairy? Wouldn' be talkin' 'bou me, now would yeh? The trio wheels, spots Hagrid grinning at them. They instantly look guilty.
HARRY: What's that you've got, Hagrid?
HAGRID: Flesh-Eatin' Slug Repellent. Fer the Mandrakes, yeh know. Accordin' ter Professor Sprout, they still got a bit o' growin' up ter do, but once their acne clears up, we'll be able to chop 'em up, stew 'em, an' get those people in the hospital un-Petrified. 'Til then, you three best watch yerselves, all righ'? They nod, watch Hagrid lope away. Just then, Neville comes running up. He looks pale with fright.
NEVILLE: Harry, I don't know who did it, but... you'd better come.
HERMIONE: It had to be a Gryffindor. Nobody else knows our password. Unless, it wasn't a student...
: 
RON: Well, whoever it was, they were looking for something.
HARRY: And they found it... Tom Riddle's diary is gone.
RON: Hey, Ginny! Going to the match? Ginny looks up, startled, then shakes her head and exits.
RON: I tell you, she gets weirder and weirder by the day...
VOICE: Kill this time... Let me rip... Tear. Harry freezes. Ron and Hermione stop, knowing by his face...
RON: No... don't tell me... Harry turns, as if following the SOUND, absently touching his fingers to the wall as he glances around. Hermione studies him with great interest -- STUDIES HIS FINGERS -- then, abruptly, Harry turns away, shakes his head: it's gone. Hermione looks up, eyes vaguely upon Harry, but her mind miles away.
HERMIONE: Harry... I think I've just understood something! I've got to go to the library! As Hermione sprints back up the stairs, Harry YELLS.
HARRY: What do you understand!
: 
HARRY: The library?
RON: That's Hermione. When in doubt, go to the library
WOOD: Listen up now. We play our game, Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance. We're stronger, quicker, smarter.
WOOD: That, too. Just then, Professor McGonagall appears, barring their way.
WOOD: Professor McGonagall -- PROFESSOR McGONAGALL This match has been cancelled.
WOOD: Cancelled! They can't cancel Quidditch -- PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Silence, Wood! You will return to Gryffindor Tower now. Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley. There's something the both of you need to see.
: 
RON: Hermione! PROFESSOR McGONAGALL She was found near the library. Along with this. Does it mean anything to either of you? She holds up a SMALL CIRCULAR MIRROR. Harry shakes his head. McGonagall nods gravely, leads them out. As they go, the CAMERA DRIFTS to HERMIONE'S HAND. Clinched tight in her stiff knuckles, barely visible, is... a PIECE OF
NEVILLE: Haven't any of the teachers noticed that the Slytherins are all safe? Isn't it obvious all this stuff's coming from Slytherin? The Heir of Slytherin, the monster of Slytherin -- why don't they just chuck all the Slytherins out?
: 
SEAMUS: They can't close Hogwarts. Where would we all go?
HARRY: We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron. I can't believe it's him. But if he did set the monster loose last time -- even by accident -- he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets. And that's a start.
RON: But you heard McGonagall. We're not allowed to leave the tower except for class --
HARRY: I think it's time to get my Dad's old Cloak out again.
HAGRID: Who's there?
HARRY: What's that for?
HAGRID: Nothin', nothin'. I've been expectin'... Doesn't matter. Sit down... I'll make tea... Hagrid nervously takes the kettle, spills the water..
HARRY: Are you okay? Hagrid? Did you hear about Hermione?
HAGRID: Oh, yea. I heard, all righ'.
HARRY: Look... we have to ask you something. Do you know who's opened the Chamber of Secrets? Hagrid takes a fruit cake, stops, about to answer, when... there is a LOUD KNOCK. The fruitcake SMASHES to the floor. Panicked, Harry and Ron throw the cloak over themselves. Sweating, Hagrid grabs his crossbow, points it at the door.
HAGRID: C-come in. The door opens. A grim Dumbledore enters, followed by a portly man in a pin-stripe suit and bowler: CORNELIUS
DUMBLEDORE: Good evening, Hagrid.
: 
RON: That's Dad's boss! Cornelius Fudge. The Minister of Magic!
HAGRID: I never... You know I never, Professor Dumbledore, sir...
DUMBLEDORE: I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence.
HAGRID: Take me? Where? Not Azkaban prison.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Already here, Fudge? Good, good...
HAGRID: What're you doin' here! Get outta my house!
: 
LUCIUS MALFOY: My dear man, please believe me, I have no pleasure at all in being inside your -- do you call this a house? I simply called at the school and was told the Headmaster was here.
DUMBLEDORE: And what exactly did you want with me, Lucius?
LUCIUS MALFOY: Dreadful thing, Dumbledore, but the governors feel it's time for you to step aside. This is an Order of Suspension. You'll find all twelve signatures on it. I'm afraid we feel you're losing your touch. What with all these attacks, there'll be no Muggle- borns left at Hogwarts. And we all know what an awful loss that would be. Malfoy hands Fudge an OFFICIAL ROLL of PARCHMENT.
LUCIUS MALFOY: That remains to be seen, but as all twelve governors have voted --
HAGRID: An' how many did yeh have ter threaten before they agreed!
LUCIUS MALFOY: I would advise you not to shout at the Azkaban guards like that.
HAGRID: Yeh can take Dumbledore! Take him away an' the Muggle-borns won' stand a chance! There'll be killin's next!
: 
DUMBLEDORE: Calm yourself, Hagrid! If the governors want my removal, Lucius, I shall of course step aside. However... you will find that I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me. You will also find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who... ask for it. Dumbledore's eyes drift -- unmistakably -- to Harry.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Admirable sentiments. We shall all miss your highly individual way of running things, Albus, and only hope your successor will manage to prevent any more, um, killin's. Malfoy strides to the door and bows Dumbledore out. Fudge, fiddling with his bowler, waits for Hagrid. Instead, Hagrid stands his ground, takes a deep breath and says carefully...
HAGRID: If anyone wanted ter find out some stuff, all they'd have ter do is follow the spiders. That'd lead 'em right! Tha's all I'm sayin'. Fudge stares at Hagrid in amazement, then follows him out. As the door SLAMS SHUT, FANG starts to HOWL, scratching at the closed door. Harry and Ron emerge from the cloak.
RON: Hagrid's right. With Dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day.
HARRY: Look... At the windowsill, a TRAIL OF SPIDERS escapes through a crack in the glass. Harry grabs Hagrid's LANTERN.
HARRY: C'mon.
RON: What are you doing?
HARRY: You heard Hagrid. Follow the spiders.
RON: They're heading into the Dark Forest. Harry sighs, heads off. Terrified, Ron grabs Fang, follows.
RON: Why spiders. Why couldn't it be 'Follow the butterflies'?
HARRY: There's something moving over there... something big. Just then a BLAZE of LIGHT splinters the trees, blinding them. They start to flee... when Ron stops.
RON: Harry!... Harry, it's our car! Scratched and mud-smeared, with bits of earth and grass sprouting from its headlamps and hubcaps -- the Ford Anglia looks half-animal. Ron circles it in wonder.
: 
HARRY: It's been here all the time! Look at it. The Forest has turned it wild.
HARRY: C'mon, we don't want to lose the trail.
RON: I don't have a good feeling about this, Harry --
HARRY: Don't panic. As Harry steps to the mouth of the cavern, the AIR suddenly CRACKLES with MOVEMENT. TWIGS SNAP. A HUGE SHADOW emerges, slowly engulfs Harry. He peers up.
ARAGOG: You do not come from the forest. Your hearts beat like... men.
HARRY: Yes. We're friends of Hagrid's. And you... you're... ... Aragog, aren't you?
: 
ARAGOG: Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before.
HARRY: He's in trouble. Up at school, there've been attacks. They think it's Hagrid. They think he's opened the Chamber of Secrets. Like before. As Harry talks, Ron's eyes dart warily about, then... RON'S POV - a pair of long legs -- SPIDER'S LEGS -- curl slowly around the trunk of the tree to his left. Terrified, Ron NUDGES Harry, but Harry ignores him.
ARAGOG: That's a lie! Hagrid never opend the Chamber of Secrets!
HARRY: But if Hagrid never... that means... you're not the monster.
ARAGOG: The monster was born in the castle. I came from a distant land, in the pocket of a traveler. Ron turns. TWO CRAWLING SILHOUETTES inch forward. Pause. Waiting. Watching.
RON: Harry...
HARRY: Shhh! But if you're not the monster, what did kill that girl fifty years ago?
ARAGOG: We do not speak of it! It is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others.
HARRY: But have you seen it?
: 
ARAGOG: I never saw any part of the castle but the cupboard in which Hagrid kept me. The girl was discovered in a bathroom. When I was accused, Hagrid brought me here. More SCRABBLING. Ron looks up. We PAN UP with him. SEE: SPIDERS -- in high and low branches -- DROPPING DOWNWARD like paratroopers. Ron GRABS Harry.
HARRY: What! Ron points. Harry looks. Pales. Turns slowly back to Aragog.
HARRY: Well... thank you. We'll just go...
ARAGOG: Go? I think not. My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command. But I cannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into our midst. Goodbye, friend of Hagrid. Aragog turns, disappears into the shadows of the cavern.
RON: Can we panic now? CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! Harry and Ron SPIN. A GANG of FIVE-FOOT SPIDERS bar the path ahead. Begin to move forward. Harry and Ron SPIN again: SPIDERS. Everywhere. CLOSING IN. Desperately, Harry swings the LANTERN in his hand. The spiders falter, then CREEP FORWARD again as the ARC of the LIGHT chases itself away. Around and around. Then: The LANTERN goes out. Harry pitches it aside. As one, he and Ron draw their wands.
RON: Nice knowing you.
: 
HARRY: Let's go! Harry, Ron and Fang LEAP INSIDE. Ron SHIFTS FRANTICALLY. A SPIDER appears at Harry's open window.
HARRY: 
RON: 
RON: Thanks for that.
: 
HARRY: Don't mention it. They stop. Both hear it: a DISTANT CLICKING. As the car flies over a ridge, they see them: a SEA OF SPIDERS heading straight for them like a herd of raging wildebeest. Ron puts his foot to the floor, SPINS the wheel and sends the car sliding away. The spiders STAMPEDE after.
HARRY: That way! It's the only way out! Hurry! They're catching up! Ron JAMS the accelerator... just as a GIANT TARANTULA drops in front of the escape route. Harry and Ron are as good as dead.
HARRY: Can you get us in the air?
RON: Flying gear's jammed! The spiders behind DRAW CLOSER. The TARANTULA waits ahead. Harry claps his hand over Ron's on the gear shift, pushing. The tarantula's pincers open, ready to kill, when... the GEAR SHIFT GIVES, the Anglia's wheels LIFT and the CAR FLIES OVER CAMERA, leaving the furious spiders below. The car barely avoids the rearing tarantula, then sails over the trees.
: 
RON: 'Follow the spiders'! Follow the spiders'! If he ever gets out of Azkaban, I'll kill Hagrid. I mean, what was the point of sending us in there? What have we found out?
HARRY: We know one thing. Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets. He was innocent.
MADAM POMFREY: There's no point in talking to a petrified person. She won't hear a word you're saying. Ron shifts uncomfortably.
RON: We know that, Madam Pomfrey. It's just, well, you see, we thought, maybe, we could... be with her for a bit. She's our... friend, you see, and... even if she can't hear us... I mean, it can't hurt, can it? A glint of sympathy flickers in Pomfrey's eyes.
MADAM POMFREY: Very well then. But be quick about it. As she exits, the boys step to her bed. Absently, Ron picks up the circular mirror that lies on the nightstand. Eyes Lockhart's Get Well card.
RON: You don't think Lockhart could be the heir of Slytherin, do you? Right. Forget I said it.
: 
HARRY: Wish you were here, Hermione. We need you. Now more than ever... Just then, the mirror in Ron's hand CATCHES the LATE AFTERNOON SUNLIGHT and casts a jagged FLAME across Hermione's hand. Harry watches the light dance over her fingers... then looks closer. Sees the paper clutched there.
HARRY: 'Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the Basilisk. Capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye. Spiders flee before it and only the crowing of the rooster can kill it.' Ron! This is it! The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a Basilisk. That's why I can hear it speak. It's a snake.
RON: But it kills by looking people in the eye. Why is it no one's dead? Harry frowns, contemplating this, then catches he and Ron's REFLECTION in the window opposite. He mutters
HARRY: Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly at least... Colin saw it through his camera. Justin -- Justin must've seen the Basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick! Nick got the full blast of it, but he's a ghost -- he couldn't die again...
: 
: 
HARRY: ... And Hermione... had the mirror! I bet you anything she was using it to look round corners, in case it came along.
RON: And Mrs. Norris? I'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, Harry.
HARRY: The water... there was water on the floor that night. She only saw the Basilisk's reflection... The crowing of the rooster is fatal to it! That's why Hagrid's roosters were killed! Spiders flee before it! It all fits!
RON: But how's the Basilisk been getting around? A dirty great snake. Someone would have seen...
HARRY: Hermione answered that too. Harry points. Scribbled, in Hermione's hand, is: "Pipes."
RON: Pipes...? It's using the plumbing.
HARRY: Remember what Aragog said? About that girl fifty years ago? She died in a bathroom. What if she never left.
RON: Moaning Myrtle! Harry nods. Just then, McGonagall's VOICE ECHOES throughout the castle, magically magnified.
: 
GILDEROY LOCKHART: So sorry. Dozed off. What have I missed?
SNAPE: Just the man. A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment has come at last.
GILDEROY LOCKHART: My m-moment?
SNAPE: Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?
GILDEROY LOCKHART: D-did I? I don't recall... PROFESSOR McGONAGALL That settles it. We'll leave it to you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy. Your skills, after all, are legend.
: 
GILDEROY LOCKHART: V-very well. I'll -- I'll be in my office, getting -- getting ready.
PROFESSOR SPROUT: Who is it the monster's taken, Minerva? PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Ginny Weasley. Ron's knees give way. As Harry catches him, the staff scatters, revealing what is written on the wall: Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever.
RON: She knew something, Harry. She'd found out something about the Chamber of Secrets. That's why she was taken. I mean, she was -- is -- a pure-blood. There can't be any other reason.
HARRY: C'mon. Let's go see Lockhart. He may be a brainless git, but he's going to try and get into the Chamber. We can tell him what we know...
RON: Harry. D'you think there's any chance at all she's not, you know -- Harry glances over, studies Ron's tortured eyes.
HARRY: We'll find her, Ron. Ginny's going to be fine.
: 
HARRY: Professor, we've got some information for you -- Harry and Ron stop dead. Lockhart's office is stripped to the shelves. Two LARGE TRUNKS stand open.
HARRY: Are you going somewhere?
GILDEROY LOCKHART: Um, well, yes. Urgent call. Unavoidable. Got to go...
RON: What about my sister?
GILDEROY LOCKHART: Well, as to that -- most unfortunate. No one regrets more than I --
RON: You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher! You can't go now!
GILDEROY LOCKHART: I must say, when I took the job, nothing in the job description --
: 
HARRY: You're running away? After all that stuff you did in your books?
GILDEROY LOCKHART: Books can be misleading.
HARRY: You wrote them!
GILDEROY LOCKHART: My dear boy, do use your common sense. My books wouldn't have sold half as well if people didn't think I'd done all those things. No one wants to read about some ugly old Armenian warlock, even if he did save a village from werewolves. He'd look dreadful on the front cover. No dress sense at all...
HARRY: You're a fraud! You've just been taking credit for what a load of other wizards have done!
GILDEROY LOCKHART: Harry, Harry, Harry. There was work involved. I had to track these people down and ask them exactly how they managed to do what they did. No, it's not all book signings and publicity photos. You want fame, you have to be prepared for a long, hard slog.
RON: Is there anything you can do?
GILDEROY LOCKHART: Yes, now that you mention it. I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms. Otherwise, you see, all those wizards would've gone blabbing and I'd never have sold another book. I'm afraid I'll have to do the same to you both, lest you do the same. Lockhart lifts his wand, but Harry is quicker.
: 
HARRY: Expelliarmus! Lockhart BLASTS backwards, toppling into one of the open trunks, his wand flying across the floor.
HARRY: Looks like those Dueling Lessons came in handy after all, Professor.
MOANING MYRTLE: Who's there? Oh... Hello, Harry. What do you want?
HARRY: To ask you how you died.
MOANING MYRTLE: Oooooh, it was dreadful. It happened right here. In this very cubicle. I'd hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in.
HARRY: Who was it, Myrtle?
MOANING MYRTLE: I don't know! I was distraught! But they said something funny. A kind of made-up language. And I realized it was a boy speaking. So I unlocked the door, to tell him to go away, and... I died.
HARRY: Just like that? How?
: 
MOANING MYRTLE: No idea. I just remember seeing a pair of great big yellow eyes. Over there...
HARRY: This is it, Ron. This is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.
RON: Say something, Harry. Say something in Parseltongue. Harry stares off self-consciously at the tiny snake.
HARRY: Open up. Ron shakes his head. Harry's spoken in his regular voice.
RON: English. Harry concentrates harder this time, staring so intensely that the snake almost looks alive. When, finally, he speaks, it is more like a HISS. Parseltongue. The circular group of sinks OPEN and a LARGE, OPEN PIPE is exposed.
GILDEROY LOCKHART: Excellent, Harry. Good work. Well then. I'll just be going. There's no need for me...
HARRY: Oh, yes there is. You first. Harry points his wand at Lockhart, then the opening.
GILDEROY LOCKHART: Now, boys. What good will it do?
RON: A bloody lot of good if it's a two-hundred-foot drop onto jagged rocks.
: 
GILDEROY LOCKHART: It's really quite filthy down here.
HARRY: All right. Let's go.
MOANING MYRTLE: Oh, Harry... if you die down there, you're welcome to share my toilet.
HARRY: Thanks, Myrtle. Harry turns. Jumps. Seconds later, Ron follows.
HARRY: Lumos! The torch blooms with a BRIGHT ORANGE FLAME.
HARRY: Remember. Any sign of movement, close your eyes straight away. Harry leads the way down the tunnel. CRUNCH! They look down: a rat's skull. All around them, the ground is littered with TINY SKELETONS. Ron squints, sees something HUGE and CURVED lying ahead. When he speaks, his voice is hollow with dread.
: 
RON: What's that? Up ahead?
GILDEROY LOCKHART: That looks like a... snake. Terrified, Lockhart quickly HIDES HIS EYES.
HARRY: Maybe it's asleep. Ron draws his wand as they approach, squinting. Harry shines his light, revealing... a gigantic COIL of EMPTY
RON: Bloody hell. Whatever shed this must be twenty feet long. Or more. THUD! They turn. Lockhart has passed out.
RON: Heart of a lion, this one. Ron kneels by him, when... Lockhart's eyes open and, quick as a fox... he snatches Ron's wand and scrambles to his feet.
GILDEROY LOCKHART: The adventure ends here, boys! But don't fret. The world will know our story. How I was too late to save the girl. How you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body. I'll even bind a limited edition in this snake skin. Say goodbye to your memories. Obliviate! Ron's WAND EXPLODES like a small BOMB, BLASTING Lockhart OFF HIS FEET and SPITTING great JETS of FIRE into the rock above. As RUBBLE RAINS, Ron LEAPS one way and Harry the other. Harry sits up, squints through the settling dust. A SOLID WALL of BROKEN ROCK seals the tunnel between him and Ron. INTERCUT Harry and Ron.
HARRY: Ron? Are you okay?
: 
RON: I'm okay. This git's not, though. He got blasted by my wand.
RON: What now?
HARRY: Wait here. I'll go on. I'll go on and... find Ginny. If I'm not back in an hour... He leaves it there.
RON: I'll try and shift some of this rock. So you can get back through. And, Harry --
HARRY: See you in a bit. Harry glances at the snake skin at his feet, moves off. He steps carefully through the shadows until he reaches a TOWERING STONE WALL, carved with TWIN SERPENTS.
HARRY: Open. The serpents part and the GIANT WALL SLIDES OPEN. Harry removes his wand and ENTERS.
HARRY: Ginny! Please don't be dead. Wake up! Wake up! Ginny!
: 
TOM RIDDLE: She won't wake. Harry spins. Tom Riddle stands nearby. He is strangely BLURRED around the edges, as though Harry was looking at him through a misted window.
HARRY: Tom... Tom Riddle? What d'you mean, she won't wake? She's not...
TOM RIDDLE: She's still alive. But only just.
HARRY: Are you a ghost?
TOM RIDDLE: A memory. Preserved in a diary for fifty years. Harry looks to the diary in Ginny's hand, then places his own hand on Ginny's arm.
HARRY: She's cold as ice. You've got to help me, Tom. There's a basilisk --
TOM RIDDLE: It won't come until it's called. Harry looks up, sees Riddle twirling a wand in his fingers.
HARRY: Give me my wand, Tom.
TOM RIDDLE: You won't be needing it.
HARRY: Listen, we've got to go! We've got to save her!
TOM RIDDLE: I'm afraid I can't do that, Harry. You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker... I grow stronger.
HARRY: But she's dying!
: 
TOM RIDDLE: Yes. I'm afraid so. But then, she's been in so much pain, poor Ginny. She's been writing to me for months, telling me all her pitiful worries and woes. Ginny poured her soul out to me. I grew stronger on a diet of her deepest fears, her darkest secrets. I grew powerful enough to start feeding Ginny a few secrets, to start pouring a bit of my soul back into her... Riddle, growing less vaporous by the second, grins cruelly.
TOM RIDDLE: Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets.
HARRY: No... she couldn't -- she wouldn't.
TOM RIDDLE: It was Ginny who set the Basilisk on the Mudbloods and the Squib's cat. Ginny who wrote threatening messages on the walls.
HARRY: But... Why?...
TOM RIDDLE: Because I told her to. You'll find that I can be very persuasive. Not that she knew what she was doing. She was, shall we say, in a kind of trance. Still, the power of the diary began to scare her and she tried to dispose of it in the girls' bathroom. But then, who should find it... but you. The very person I was most anxious to meet.
HARRY: And why did you want to meet me?
: 
TOM RIDDLE: Ginny told me all about you. I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust.
HARRY: Hagrid's my friend. And you framed him, didn't you?
TOM RIDDLE: It was my word against Hagrid's. Only Dumbledore seemed to think Hagrid was innocent.
HARRY: I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.
TOM RIDDLE: I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school. So I decided to leave behind a diary, preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day... I would be able to lead another to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work.
HARRY: Well, you haven't finished it this time. In a few hours Mandrake Draught will be ready and everyone who was petrified will be all right again.
TOM RIDDLE: Haven't I told you, that killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore? For many months now, my new target has been... you. Imagine my disappointment when I learned Ginny had stolen the diary back from you.
HARRY: Ginny stole the diary from my room? But why?
: 
TOM RIDDLE: She was afraid. Afraid you'd learn how to work the diary. Afraid I'd tell you just who it was that had been strangling all those roosters. Horrified, Harry glances at Ginny, growing more PALE, then back to Riddle, who is growing more SOLID.
TOM RIDDLE: Come now, Harry. Don't look so disappointed. Had Ginny succeeded in destroying the diary, she would have destroyed me. And we couldn't be having this little talk. And I have so many questions for you.
HARRY: Like what?
TOM RIDDLE: Well, how is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent managed to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?
HARRY: Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.
TOM RIDDLE: Voldemort is my past, present and future. Riddle pulls Harry's wand from his pocket and begins to trace it through the air, writing three words: "TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE." Then, with a wave, he re-arranges them:
HARRY: You. You're the heir of Slytherin. You're Voldemort?
TOM RIDDLE: Surely you didn't think I would keep my filthy Muggle father's name?
: 
: 
TOM RIDDLE: No, I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world.
HARRY: Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!
TOM RIDDLE: Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me.
HARRY: He'll never be gone! Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him! Suddenly, MUSIC... EERIE and UNEARTHLY... ECHOES deep within the chamber and a small, swift SHADOW ribbons over the rock. Flying from above is FAWKES, the Phoenix. The bird SWOOPS into the chamber, clutching a RAGGED BUNDLE in its golden talons.
HARRY: Fawkes. Fawkes flies toward Harry, drops the ragged bundle, which is the SORTING HAT, at his feet. Riddle picks it up.
TOM RIDDLE: This is what Dumbledore sends his defender! A songbird and an old hat! Riddle tosses aside the hat. He turns to the statue of Salazar Slytherin and speaks in Parseltongue.
TOM RIDDLE: Speak to me, Slytherin. Suddenly, the stone face's MOUTH OPENS. There is a RUMBLING SOUND, followed by the sound of SLITHERING. Harry turns away. The Basilisk, A GIANT SERPENT, spills out, uncoiling heavily to the floor. Harry turns to the wall. The shadow of the serpent is visible on the wall. PAN TO Tom Riddle, looking at Harry.
: 
TOM RIDDLE: Let's match the powers of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against the famous Harry Potter, shall we? Riddle turns, to serpent, speaking in Parseltongue.
TOM RIDDLE: Kill him! The HISSING SERPENT shoots forward. Harry turns, RUNS away.
TOM RIDDLE: Parseltongue won't save you now, Potter. The Basilisk only obeys me.
HARRY: Don't look. Don't look into its eyes. Harry RACES along the stone path, but the giant serpent is FASTER. Harry TRIPS. FALLS. The Basilisk RISES. Harry looks to the wall, sees the serpent about to strike. Suddenly FAWKES SCREECHES, soaring toward the Basilisk and circling its blunt head, confusing it. The SNAKE SNAPS furiously, when... Fawkes drops like a knife, driving its talons deep into the serpent's glittering eyes. As Harry watches the angry play of shadows on the wall, the BASILISK ROARS, HISSING in pain. Fawkes wings away, its talons dripping with blood and Harry turns, LOOKS: the Basilisk's eyes are a blind, bloody mess.
TOM RIDDLE: Fool! Think you're safe! It can still hear you! As Harry flees, the serpent thunders after, STRIKING BLINDLY as its whipping tail SHATTERS a Slytherin STATUE. Harry dodges and ducks, then, seeing the snake about to strike again... LEAPS CLEAR, stumbling toward a SIDE
: 
: 
TOM RIDDLE: Yes, Potter. The process is nearly complete. In a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be dead. And I will cease to be a memory. Lord Voldemort will return. Very much... alive. Harry moves toward Ginny, then suddenly... the BASILISK SHOOTS OUT of the TUNNEL, HISSING directly in front of Harry. Trapped, Harry glances around, then -- impulsively -- LEAPS upward, begins to scale the statue of Salazar Slytherin. The serpent strikes madly, but Harry continues on, CLIMBING BOLDLY until he reaches the top. He turns. Sees the Sorting Hat. Sees what glitters within: the RUBY HANDLE of a SWORD. Harry WHEELS, sword in hand, and fends off the slashing serpent like St. George and the dragon. In a mad rush of courage, he PITCHES HIMSELF onto the serpent, SLIDES DOWN its back and rolls up, SWORD RAISED. Too tired to flee, Harry simply waits. The serpent rises and, FANGS
TOM RIDDLE: Remarkable, isn't it? How quickly the venom of the Basilisk penetrates the body? If you have any final words, Potter, you'd best speak them now. I'd guess you have little more than a minute to live. Harry blinks heavily, watching as the skin of his forearm turns a troubling gray.
: 
TOM RIDDLE: So ends the famous Harry Potter. On his knees in the Chamber of Secrets. Defeated at last by the Dark Lord he so unwisely challenged. You'll be back with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry... As Riddle talks, Harry glances at Ginny, nearly white now, a small ghost, the only evidence of life the TREMBLING OF A SINGLE FINGER. Harry studies the finger and what lies beneath it: Tom Riddle's diary. Harry begins to crawl toward her.
: 
TOM RIDDLE: Funny, isn't it? The damage a silly little book can do? Especially in the hands of a silly little girl. As Harry reaches Ginny, he places his hand on hers, then... slips the diary free.
TOM RIDDLE: What are you doing? No. Stop... Riddle's face creases in fear. He LUNGES FORWARD. But Harry is too quick. Raising his hand high... he PLUNGES THE FANG into the book. Instantly, BLACK INK SPURTS from the pages.
TOM RIDDLE: No! Riddle SHRIEKS, writhing in pain. His body begins to wither instantly, growing BLURRY once more. As the ink runs off Harry's fingers to the floor, Riddle VANISHES altogether. Harry sinks back, then... hears a FAINT MOAN. Ginny STIRS, color blooming in her cheeks. As she sees Harry, she SOBS.
GINNY: Harry. It was me! But I swear, I didn't mean to... Riddle made me. He wrote to me... took me over... I didn't even know whose diary it was. I found it inside my cauldron. The day we all went to Diagon Alley and... Harry. You're hurt...
HARRY: Ginny. You need to get yourself out... Follow the chamber... You'll find Ron... There is a RUSH OF WINGS and Fawkes circles down, lays his head onto Harry's arm.
HARRY: You were brilliant, Fawkes. I just... wasn't quick enough. Then Harry blinks, looks down. Thick pearly TEARS are trickling down Fawkes' face and onto his arm. Almost instantly, his wound... begins to heal itself.
: 
HARRY: Of course. Dumbledore told me. Phoenix tears have healing powers. It's all right, Ginny. It's over. It's just a memory...
RON: Ginny! Ron wriggles through, rushes forward and hugs Ginny.
RON: You're alive. I can't believe it.
GINNY: I'm going to be expelled, I just know it!
RON: Remind you of anyone?
HARRY: Where's Lockhart? Harry eyes Lockhart, sitting by himself, HUMMING placidly.
RON: His Memory Charm backfired. Hasn't got a clue who he is. I keep having to stop him wandering off. He's a danger to himself.
GILDEROY LOCKHART: Hello. Odd sort of place, this, isn't it? Do you live here?
RON: No. Ron turns, raises his eyebrows at Harry. Harry looks upward. There is an opening, hundreds of feet up. Just then, Fawkes circles back, fluttering in front of Harry.
: 
RON: What's with the bird?
HARRY: I think... I think he's telling me he can take us out of here.
GILDEROY LOCKHART: Amazing! This is just like magic!
DUMBLEDORE: Ingenious. Simply... ingenious. Of course, Tom Riddle was probably the most brilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen. I taught him myself fifty years ago. After he left, I would occasionally hear stories of his activities -- dark rumors -- but after awhile, even the rumors stopped. When he finally resurfaced as Lord Voldemort, most people had completely forgotten the clever Head Boy he'd once been.
GINNY: I didn't know whose diary it was, sir. I swear. I found it inside my cauldron. The day we all went to Diagon Alley.
: 
GINNY: But I understand if... given all the trouble I've caused... if you --
DUMBLEDORE: Wiser wizards than you have been hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort, Miss Weasley. No, I think you've endured enough. I would suggest a bit of bed rest, however. And perhaps a large mug of hot chocolate. I always find that cheers me up. Minerva, will you show Arthur and Molly up to the hospital wing? PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Certainly, Albus. As they exit, Harry and Ron watch them go. Mrs. Weasley's VOICE carries:
MRS. WEASLEY: A diary that writes back to you! Honestly, Ginny! What were you thinking? Haven't I always told you? Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can't see where it keeps its brain! Harry and Ron turn back. See Dumbledore regarding them gravely.
DUMBLEDORE: You two realize, of course, that in the last few hours, you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules?
DUMBLEDORE: And that there is sufficient evidence to expel you both?
: 
DUMBLEDORE: Therefore, it seems only fitting... That you both receive Special Awards for Services to the School. And -- let me see -- yes, I think two hundred points apiece, which, I believe, should be more than enough to secure Gryffindor the House Cup.
: 
DUMBLEDORE: Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would, have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban. We need our gamekeeper back. Ron nods, takes the envelope and exits.
DUMBLEDORE: First, Harry, I want to thank you. You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you. Secondly, I sense you're troubled by something. Am I right?
HARRY: It's just, you see, sir, I couldn't help noticing certain things. Certain similarities. Between Tom Riddle and me.
: 
DUMBLEDORE: You can speak Parseltongue, Harry, because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue. Unless I'm much mistaken, he transformed some of his own powers to you the night he gave you that scar.
HARRY: Voldemort put a bit of himself in me?
DUMBLEDORE: Not intentionally, but... yes.
HARRY: So the Sorting Hat was right. I should be a Slytherin.
DUMBLEDORE: It's true, Harry. You do possess many of the qualities Voldemort himself prizes. Resourcefulness. Determination. A certain disregard for the rules. Yet the Sorting Hat placed you in Gryffindor.
HARRY: Only because I asked it to.
DUMBLEDORE: Exactly. Which makes you very different from Voldemort. It's not our abilities that show what we truly are, Harry. It's our choices. If you want proof that you belong in Gryffindor, Harry, I suggest you look more closely at this. Dumbledore hands the bloodstained sword to Harry. An ENGRAVED NAME glimmers above the ruby-encrusted hilt.
HARRY: 'Godric Gryffindor.'
DUMBLEDORE: Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the Hat.
HARRY: Dobby! This is your Master? The family you serve is the Malfoys! Dobby nods, chagrined. Lucius Malfoy brushes past Harry.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Out of my way, Potter. So! You've returned!
DUMBLEDORE: Yes. When the governors heard that Arthur Weasley's daughter had been taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back. Curiously, several of them seemed under the impression that you would curse their families if they didn't agree to suspend me in the first place, Lucius.
LUCIUS MALFOY: From the beginning, my only concern has been the welfare of this school and its students. I assume the culprit has been identified.
DUMBLEDORE: Oh yes. It was Voldemort. Only this time, he chose to act through someone else. By means of... this. As Dumbledore nudges the diary toward Lucius Malfoy, Harry sees Dobby nod meaningfully from the diary to Lucius.
DUMBLEDORE: Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it. One only hopes that no more of Lord Voldemort's old school things find their way into innocent hands. The consequences for the one responsible could be... severe.
: 
LUCIUS MALFOY: Come, Dobby. We're leaving. As Dobby scuttles toward the door, Lucius Malfoy KICKS HIM through it, then exits himself. Harry stares at the empty doorway as DOBBY'S PAINFUL SQUEALS ECHO from the corridor.
HARRY: Sir? I wonder if I could have that. Dumbledore looks up, follows Harry's eyes to the diary.
HARRY: Mr. Malfoy! I have something of yours. Harry comes up running, thrusts the diary into Malfoy's hand.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Mine? I don't know what you're talking about.
HARRY: I think you do, sir. I think you slipped it into Ginny Weasley's cauldron that day in Diagon Alley. Malfoy shoves the diary into Dobby's face, then leans close to Harry and, with a nasty grin, WHISPERS:
LUCIUS MALFOY: Prove it! He turns away. As Dobby looks sadly back, clutching the diary in his hand, Harry mouths the words: Open it. Dobby looks down curiously. Inside... is a SOCK. He
: 
DOBBY: Master has given Dobby a sock. Master has presented Dobby with clothes. Dobby is... free!
LUCIUS MALFOY: What? I didn't -- He wheels, sees Harry standing with one leg crossed: His right ankle is bare. Instantly, Malfoy charges forth.
LUCIUS MALFOY: You've lost me my servant!
DOBBY: You shall not harm Harry Potter! Dobby steps between and -- BANG! Malfoy flies backwards, lands in a crumpled heap. Rising, he stares murderously at Harry.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Mark my words, Harry Potter. You'll meet the same sticky end as your parents one of these days. They were meddlesome fools too. With that, he turns, storms off.
DOBBY: Harry Potter freed Dobby! How can Dobby ever repay him?
HARRY: Just promise me something.
DOBBY: Anything, sir.
HARRY: Never try to save my life again. Dobby grins then and -- CRACK! -- is gone.
: 
HERMIONE: You solved it! You solved it!
HARRY: With loads of help from you. She turns to embrace Ron. They pause, an awkward moment between them and... shake hands instead.
RON: Welcome back, Hermione. McGonagall taps her goblet. Dumbledore stands.
DUMBLEDORE: Before we begin our feast, let's give a round of applause to Professor Sprout and Madame Pomfrey, whose Mandrake Juice has been successfully administered to all those who had been petrified. Everyone applauds.
DUMBLEDORE: Also, in the wake of recent events, as a school treat, all exams have been cancelled. Everyone cheers, save for Hermione.
HERMIONE: Oh, no! At the rear of the Hall, the great doors OPEN. It's Hagrid. He enters. Stops. Looks around. The room falls SILENT. All eyes upon him. He glances around. Nervous. Embarrassed.
HAGRID: Sorry I'm late. The owl deliverin' my release papers got all lost 'n confused. Some ruddy bird named Errol.
: 
HAGRID: I jus' want to say... that if it wasn't fer' you, Harry... you an' Ron... and Hermione... Well, I jus' want to say... Thanks.
HARRY: There's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid. Just then... Dumbledore gets to his feet and... slowly... brings his hands together. The others join him. Soon, everyone is on their feet and the Hall ROARING. As the students surround Hagrid, he blinks, wipes at his eyes, and... CAMERA PULLS BACK, THROUGH the window, leaving the celebration. WE CONTINUE TO CRANE BACK... BACK... TO a WIDE SHOT OF HOGWARTS... glittering gloriously in the night.
